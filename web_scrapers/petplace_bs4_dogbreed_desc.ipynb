They are not well-suited for guard dog work, as they are friendly to most people, including strangers. The Malamute likes to stay active and enjoys leisurely backpacking, hiking, or walking with the family. They are best suited for cooler environments due to their double coat and will easily overheat in warmer weather. They are relatively quiet and don\\'t bark often. Instead, they howl when bored or persuaded by either human voices or sirens. The Alaskan Malamute is a truly beautiful, affectionate breed that loves being part of the family.',\n",

       " 'yorkshire-terrier': \"The Yorkshire Terrier is an extremely intelligent, energetic, and confident breed. They are a loving and devoted canine capable of being a great family pet. Yorkshire Terriers also make great apartment animals, due to their toy-breed size. They're brave despite their small stature, making them the perfect watch or alert dog. Their appearance is rather regal, due to their long, silky hair, and they love being a pampered pet, even allowing owners to carry them in shoulder bags.\"}"
