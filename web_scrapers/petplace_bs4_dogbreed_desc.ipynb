Bred to seek out large game like deer, bear, and boar, they were called M atagi Inu (\"esteemed dog hunter\") in their native country. Akitas are very loyal to their families, but may exhibit aggression towards strangers and other animals. Considered one of the most beautiful breeds, the Akita is often said to look like a \"teddy bear\" as a puppy. But don\\'t be fooled, this puppy grows rapidly into a beautiful and strong adult dog that requires a consistent, strong, and positive handler.

They were bred for their ability to haul heavy goods across hundreds of miles of treacherous mountain terrain. Their thick, double haircoat is what allows them to survive in harsh climates. The Malamute was built for endurance, not speed, which is made evident by their large size and massive bone structure. The breed was well respected among Alaska\\'s indigenous people, based on their hardworking nature and resilience. The Malamute is highly intelligent and a true pack dog. They will dominate any family member (adults, children, or other dogs) that has not earned their respect and, therefore, require very early socialization and training to establish both your role and theirs within the \"pack.\" After firm (yet positive) early training, the Malamute will become a devoted and loyal family pet. They are not well-suited for guard dog work, as they are friendly to most people, including strangers. The Malamute likes to stay active and enjoys leisurely backpacking, hiking, or walking with the family. They are best suited for cooler environments due to their double coat and will easily overheat in warmer weather. They are relatively quiet and don\\'t bark often. Instead, they howl when bored or persuaded by either human voices or sirens. The Alaskan Malamute is a truly beautiful, affectionate breed that loves being part of the family.',\n",

Socialization is critical at a young age for these dogs and they do best with an experienced owner.

They are silent workers with incredible endurance, a sharp sense of smell, excellent hearing, and tremendous heat tolerance. They are also extremely protective and loyal dogs, enjoying being a part of the family as much as their Dalmatian ancestors. As a true herding breed, the Australian Cattle Dog requires a lot of exercise and is best suited for families with an active lifestyle.

They are tireless, requiring constant stimulation and exercise to keep them from becoming destructive. The Basenji is very cautious of strangers and does best in a household with older children (as long as properly socialized) or adults.

Basset Hounds are well known for their endearing, droopy face with sad eyes and leisurely stride. They have been used in popular culture as the face of Hush Puppies shoes and the cartoon characters \"Droopy Dog\" and \"Fred Basset.\" However, don\\'t be fooled by their gloomy appearance, because this breed is highly intelligent with a nose that can out-sniff any dog aside from the Bloodhound. They are gentle and friendly, making them an excellent companion for children. They have a low-maintenance haircoat and are generally a laidback dog, unless they are on the hunt. The Basset Hound tends to be stubborn, and has a nose that will easily distract them, so training can be difficult unless you find a way to use their extraordinary scenting abilities to your advantage.',\n",

Their name stems from pudel or pudelin, which is German for \"to splash in the water.\" The Poodle is known as Caniche in France, which stems from the phrase \"chien canard*,\"* meaning duck dog. There are three different sizes of Poodle: standard (which is the largest), miniature (medium in size), and toy (small in size). Depending on their respective size, they may excel at swimming and retrieving ducks, sniffing out truffles, or simply being pampered. They have been used for centuries as circus performers due to their trainability, athleticism, and visual appeal. Their extraordinary hair styles are not just for show. Hair is longer in certain areas to protect the joints and organs, and shorter along the back to improve swimming ability. They rarely shed, making them an ideal option for people with allergies. The breed interacts well with children and makes for a loyal family companion. Personality wise, they exude confidence and elegance, which is why they have remained a top dog breed around the world for centuries.',\n",

The Shar Pei has become less aggressive and more manageable over the years, but still requires the firm hand of a strong leader. They are best as the only pet in a household, as their assertive, stubborn nature may lead to fights with other dogs. They also lack the patience needed for interaction with kids, and, therefore, are not recommended for families with small children.
