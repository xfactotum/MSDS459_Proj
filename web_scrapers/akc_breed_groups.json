There are four basic types of Sporting dogs; spaniels, pointers, retrievers and setters. Known for their superior instincts in water and woods, many of these breeds enjoy hunting and other field activities. Many of them, especially the water-retrieving breeds, have well \u2013insulated water repellant coats, which are quite resilient to the elements. Thinking of getting one? Just realize that most require regular, invigorating exercise.",

To bring out your dog\u2019s natural smarts, you have to study the breed, put in the necessary time to train, and understand his natural traits, like whether he\u2019s a quick study or slow and steady.",

The truth is, there are no 100% hypoallergenic dogs, dog breeds, or mixed-breeds, but there are many dog breeds that are less allergenic for people with dog allergies. Dander, which is attached to pet hair, is what causes most dog allergies in people, and these dog breeds have a non-shedding coat that produces less dander. And don't fret - you aren't alone. As much as 10% to 20% of the U.S. population is allergic to dogs, according to the National Institutes of Health.",
