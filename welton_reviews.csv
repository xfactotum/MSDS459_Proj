Affenpinschers," The ""toy-terrier"" Affenpinscher is spunkier than most other toy breeds. Somewhat high-strung, he tends to tremble when excited. If he perceives an invasion of his space by an approaching stranger or strange dog, he will try to appear intimidating by becoming raucous and blustery. It might look comical, but if not nipped in the bud, an Affenpinscher may maintain his suspicious attitude even after a guest has been welcomed in. Socialization is very important with this breed to keep him under control. The Affenpinscher adores his family and is fine with other family pets, especially when raised with them. In the home, he is an inquisitive busybody who must check out new sights and sounds. His playful antics are delightfully entertaining as he bats toys around with his agile paws. Affenpinschers do have a mind of their own, and without a firm hand can be obstinate and demanding, tossing tantrums or sulking when they don't get their own way. It might make you laugh, but spoiling is not recommended for this breed, especially since he is so bright and does respond well to calm, patient training. Like most terrier-type dogs, the Affenpinscher is proud and sensitive and does not take kindly to being teased. This breed is happiest in a home without young children. If you want a dog who...

Afghan Hounds," The AKC Standard calls him ""an aristocrat, his whole appearance one of dignity and aloofness.... eyes gazing into the distance as if in memory of ages past."" Some Afghan Hounds are indeed dignified, while others are altogether silly clowns, and still others alternate gleefully between the two. Though quiet indoors, the Afghan Hound should not be left unsupervised for long periods of time without personal attention and running exercise, for he bores easily and then he can become seriously destructive. Standoffish by nature, the Afghan Hound needs extensive exposure to people and unusual sights and sounds so that his caution does not become timidity. He is sociable with other dogs, but has strong hunting/prey instincts and so he may chase smaller pets. This needs to be stopped immediately. Obedience training will control his bumptiousness and build his confidence, but you must be patient and persuasive, for sighthounds are extremely sensitive to leash jerking. They could respond defensively if frightened. Independent and not particularly eager to please, their stubbornness takes the form of resistance rather than wild disobedience, i.e. they brace their legs and refuse to walk. Don't let this breed off-leash, for he is blazing fast and can gallop out of sight in seconds. His high hipbones make him one of the most agile of all breeds and one of the best jumpers. Your fences should be at least 6 feet high, preferably 7 or 8 feet. If you want a dog who... An Afghan Hound may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Afghan Hound may not be right for you. Dog Breed Traits – Which Traits Are Right For You? In this brand new series, I'll help you decide which dog breed traits would best suit you and your family, your home and yard, and your lifestyle, so you can choose the best dog breed for your family. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Afghan Hound If I was considering an Afghan Hound, I would be most concerned about... See if there is a dog club in your area that offers an activity called lure coursing, which is chasing a mechanical lure in a controlled setting. This is an appropriate outlet for the full-speed galloping behaviors that are ""hardwired"" into your Afghan Hound's genes.  If you have young children, I do not recommend an Afghan Hound. These sensitive dogs often feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making – and stress and shyness may be the result."
Airedale Terriers," A rowdy handful as a puppy, the Airedale Terrier matures into a dignified, self-assured, courageous adult. This athletic dog romps and plays hard. Without vigorous exercise and lots of personal interaction, he is easily bored and may become destructive as he seeks to entertain himself. Young Airedale Terriers are especially rambunctious and can turn your garden into a moonscape of excavated moles and tulip bulbs. Mental stimulation (hunting, obedience, agility, playing games) is essential for this thinking breed. You can't just leave him alone all day or stick him outside and hope that he'll lie down quietly and be happy. An Airedale's attitude toward strangers varies from enthusiastically friendly to sensibly polite, but even the friendly ones tend to be vigilant watchdogs. Some individuals are more protective than others. With other dogs, most Airedale Terriers are bold and aggressive, and with their strong hunting instincts they must be exposed early to cats, else they may not be safe with cats. Rabbits and rodents are not a wise addition to the household. This breed is very smart, but also independent. Unless you establish yourself as the alpha (number one), he can be headstrong. Yet assertive owners who know how to lead will find him eminently trainable. If you want a dog who... An Airedale Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Airedale Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Airedale Terrier If I was considering an Airedale Terrier, I would be most concerned about... Airedale Terriers were never intended to be simply household pets. Their ""working"" behaviors (following scents, searching for prey animals, chasing things that run, digging, exploring) can be a nuisance in a normal household setting. Trying to suppress these ""hardwired"" behaviors, without providing alternate outlets for their high energy level, can be difficult. To teach your Airedale to listen to you, ""Respect Training"" is mandatory. My Airedale Training Page discusses the program you need."
Akitas," The Akita Inu is handsome, calm, dignified, clean (easy to housebreak), and quiet (seldom barks). So it's understandable that he might be viewed as a desirable pet! However.... the Akita Inu has a complex personality that makes him very challenging to raise. Physically powerful, reserved with strangers, and protective, the Akita Inu must be accustomed to people at an early age so that his guarding instincts remain controlled rather than indiscriminate. Akitas can be so aggressive with other dogs of the same sex that two males or two females should never be left alone together. The problem is that this breed can be difficult to ""read"" – often he does not ""posture"" (display obvious signs of aggression) – instead, an Akita may co-exist peacefully with another dog until suddenly, apparently out of the blue, a minor disagreement occurs, or perhaps the other dog pushes the Akita too far or approaches the Akita's food bowl or favorite toy, and then the Akita may attack with ferocity. Akitas can be very possessive of their food – keep children and other pets away from them during mealtime. As you might guess, cats and other small animals are also at risk around an Akita. In general, it is simply safest to keep this breed as an only pet. Training can be a challenge, for the Akita Inu is assertive, strong-willed, and bores easily. He may use his intelligence in ways that suit his own purposes. Yet owners who know how to lead will find him eminently trainable via praise and reward methods. This breed must be treated with respect – absolutely no teasing – but you must insist that he return that respect, or he will walk right over you. Akitas are not a good choice for a first-time dog owner. Unlike many other large breeds, the Akita Inu doesn't require hours of running exercise. He does well with long brisk walks and an occasional vigorous run, especially in cold weather. Akitas LOVE snow and cold. If you want a dog who... An Akita Inu may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Akita Inu may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Akita Inu If I was considering an Akita, I would be most concerned about... To teach your Akita Inu to listen to you, ""Respect Training"" is mandatory. My Akita Training Page discusses the program you need. If you have small children, I do not recommend an Akita Inu. There are just too many Akitas who don't tolerate any nonsense. Frankly, most Akitas are ""too much dog"" for the average household. Most people lack the skills necessary to manage this breed."
Alaskan Malamutes," The rugged Alaskan Malamute is a working dog, best suited to people who love the great outdoors. He plays vigorously and is most content when pulling or packing a load (sledding, ski-joring, weight pulling, backpacking), especially in cold weather. This breed should not be kept in a hot climate. Alaskan Malamutes are very challenging to train and live with. Without sufficient exercise and challenging things to do, Malamutes become rambunctious and bored, which they usually express by chronic howling and destructive chewing. Bored Alaskan Malamutes are famous for chewing through drywall, ripping the stuffing out of sofas, and turning your yard into a moonscape of giant craters. Potential aggression toward other animals is a real concern. When this breed fights, the battles can be serious and bloody. The Alaskan Malamute can be so dominant toward other dogs of the same sex that two males or two females should not be kept together unless you are a very experienced owner. Malamutes can be predatory with smaller pets. I would not keep a Malamute with a cat unless the pair has grown up together. When outdoors, Malamutes must be securely confined behind a high fence, for they can be escape artists with strong exploratory instincts. Once loose, they won't come back when you call them and they may run deer and molest livestock. On the other hand, Alaskan Malamutes are usually great with people. From their wolfish appearance, they may look like intimidating protectors, but most Mals are friendly with everyone and make miserable watchdogs. Still, this is a substantial, powerful breed, so it is essential to socialize youngsters so they grow up to trust and respect people. This self-reliant breed will test for position in the family pecking order. Unless you establish yourself as the alpha (number one), he can be headstrong and demanding. Unneutered males, especially, can be very dominant and possessive of their food. If you want a dog who... An Alaskan Malamute may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Alaskan Malamute may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Alaskan Malamute If I was considering an Alaskan Malamute, I would be most concerned about... If you have small children, or if you or anyone who lives with you is elderly or infirm, I do not recommend Alaskan Malamute puppies. The temptation to play roughly is too strong in many young Alaskan Malamutes. To keep your Alaskan Malamute in, and to keep other animals out, fences should be high, with wire sunk into the ground along the fence line to thwart digging. Gates should have the highest quality locks. Many Alaskan Malamutes are clever escape artists who will go over, under, or through fences in search of adventure. Frankly, most Alaskan Malamutes are ""too much dog"" for the average household. This is a serious working dog with tremendous strength. Very few people really have the knowledge, facilities, or skills necessary to manage this breed, or to provide the types of activities that keep him satisfied."
American Bulldogs," In the 1980s, the movie Homeward Bound  introduced the American Bulldog to the public. Since then, his popularity has skyrocketed... which isn't good. Trash-talking breeders are preying on uninformed buyers, running flashy ads, representing dogs of dubious lineage as purebred, not testing temperaments before breeding, and not certifying hips. Thus, this is a tricky breed to acquire. Several different American Bulldog clubs are vying to control the future of the breed, and politics and conflict abound. Get references, double-check everything you're told, refuse to pay outrageous prices, and look for temperament titles (BST, ATT) and obedience titles in the pedigree. The muscular American Bulldog possesses great strength, tenacity, determination, and confidence. He is best owned by active people who are interested in developing his athletic abilities in weight pulling, obedience, agility, hunting, farm work, or Schutzhund. Though usually calm and self-possessed, he must have vigorous exercise to stay fit and happy. His attitude toward strangers varies from friendly to standoffish, and even the friendly ones make vigilant guardians. Early socialization is an absolute requirement to promote a stable, discriminating temperament. The American Bulldog lives for his family and may become destructive if left alone too much. Dog aggression can be a problem; he should be thoroughly socialized with other dogs from an early age. Cats, too. Though strong-willed, he learns quickly and will respect an owner who is equally confident and consistent. Because of public/media prejudice toward any breed resembling a ""pit bull,"" American Bulldogs should be kept on-leash outside their yard and trained through at least basic obedience. If you want a dog who... An American Bulldog may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An American Bulldog may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the American Bulldog If I was considering an American Bulldog, I would be most concerned about... If you simply want a pet for your family, and don't have the time or inclination to take your dog running or hiking or swimming or biking, or to get involved in weight-pulling, or tracking, or agility (obstacle course), or schutzhund (protection), or a similar canine activity, I do not recommend this breed. American Bulldogs were never intended to be simply household pets. To teach your Bulldog to listen to you, ""Respect Training"" is mandatory.

American Cocker Spaniels," The American Cocker Spaniel should be a sweet-natured, happy, playful dog. And many individuals are. Unfortunately behavioral consultants like myself see an awful lot of American Cockers with neurotic behaviors, including nastiness. So you need to be very careful when buying or adopting a Cocker Spaniel. Obviously you want to choose one of the nice ones! The American Cocker does need regular exercise, but daily walks and romps in the backyard or at a dog park will suffice. When well socialized, American Cocker Spaniels are friendly and peaceful with strangers and other animals. Some Cockers are a bit stubborn, but most are responsive to persuasive, cheerful obedience training that includes praise and occasional food rewards. Some Cocker Spaniels, especially adolescents and young adults, are excessively submissive. These dogs might suddenly urinate (or dribble urine) when they get over-excited or feel intimidated. This might simply be someone's hand reaching to pet them, or your body looming over them during play. This is not a housebreaking issue! It's called excitable or submissive urination and it might go away with time as long as you don't punish the dog. If you want a dog who... An American Cocker Spaniel may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An American Cocker Spaniel may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the American Cocker Spaniel If I was considering an American Cocker Spaniel, I would be most concerned about... If you have small children, I would be very careful about choosing an American Cocker Spaniel. A good Cocker would be fine, but there are so many whose temperaments are suspect. Some of these dogs won't tolerate any nonsense. Others get overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making. If you combine such a sensitive individual with active children, the result might be stress that could lead to defensive biting if the dog felt startled or threatened. To teach your Cocker to listen to you, ""Respect Training"" is mandatory. My Cocker Spaniel Training Page discusses the program you need."
American Eskimo Dogs," The American Eskimo Dog is happy and high-spirited, an active dog who enjoys vigorous exercise, especially in the snow. American Eskimo Dogs, affectionately known as Eskies, are very people-oriented and crave a lot of companionship. Without enough activity (physical and mental), this creative thinker becomes bored and mischievous . . . which means destructive and noisy. Most American Eskimo Dogs are conservative with strangers, keen of eye and acute of hearing, and serious about their watchdog responsibilities, though not usually progressing to the point of aggression. However, early and frequent socialization is required to ensure that their watchfulness does not become suspicion or sharpness. Most American Eskimo Dogs are fine with other dogs, but can be jealous when other animals get attention. This breed is smart, learns quickly, and excels at performing tricks, but he is also independent and can be willful. If you don't consistently enforce the rules, an American Eskimo Dog will use his intelligence in clever ways that suit his own purposes. If you want a dog who... An American Eskimo Dog may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An American Eskimo Dog may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training.

To teach your Eskie to listen to you, ""Respect Training"" is mandatory. My American Eskimo Dog Training Page discusses the program you need."
American Pit Bull Terriers," ""Pit Bulls are dangerous."" ""Pit Bulls are sweethearts."" What to believe? In my experience, each of those statements has truth to it. Some American Pit Bull Terriers are indeed dangerous. They act aggressively toward humans or other animals. It may not be ""their fault"" in the sense that they might have inherited bad genes and/or been raised badly or abused. Yet the end result is that they're dangerous. Not the breed as a whole. But certainly some individuals. On the other hand, many Pit Bull Terriers are absolute sweethearts. So many Pit Bulls who have been poorly bred (or poorly raised or abused) never lose their trust in humans. It's enough to make you cry. The problem is that you often can't tell by looking at an individual whether he's one of the dangerous ones or one of the safe sweethearts. And of course you're reluctant to guess wrong, because of the possible consequences. So you play it safe by crossing the street. Your concern is understandable. It's sensible to recognize that there are Pit Bull Terriers still being bred for dog-fighting, or for guarding the lairs of gang bangers and drug dealers. Fortunately there are also breeders who focus on positive attributes such as intelligence, athleticism, and a keen working mind. They breed their dogs to compete in obedience trials, agility trials, or weight-pulling. American Pit Bull Terriers need at least moderate daily exercise to maintain their splendid muscle tone. You must also provide interesting activities to keep them feeling satisfied. This is not a dog to leave in the back yard with nothing to do. Pit Bulls carry themselves with an impressive, confident presence. Yet so many individuals have the soft gentle heart of a Golden Retriever and are friendly, or at least polite, with family and strangers alike. However.... attitude toward other canines is another story. Their dog-fighting ancestry dictates a strong-willed, no-nonsense kind of dog who does not take kindly to being challenged by other assertive dogs. Most Pit Bull Terriers do not start fights, but if confronted, most will readily engage. It's true that many Pit Bulls live peacefully in a house full of pets. Yet there is always the risk that dormant instincts may suddenly flare into deadly combat. As far as training goes, American Pit Bull Terriers can be stubborn. But they respond well to confident owners who know how to establish and enforce rules of expected behavior. Because of public/media prejudice, every American Pit Bull Terrier should be trained through at least basic obedience and always leashed outside of his yard. Every well-behaved Pit Bull Terrier seen on the street can help counteract anti-breed sentiment. If you want a dog who... An American Pit Bull Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An American Pit Bull Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the American Pit Bull Terrier If I was considering an American Pit Bull Terrier, I would be most concerned about... To keep your Pit Bull in, and to keep other animals out, fences should be at least six feet high. If you have a digger, sink wire into the ground along the fence line. Gates should have the highest quality locks. Frankly, most American Pit Bull Terriers are ""too much dog"" for the average household."
American Staffordshire Terriers," ""Hey, that looks like a Pit Bull!"" is the typical response when someone meets an American Staffordshire Terrier (AmStaff) for the first time. It's true. An American Staffordshire Terrier and an American Pit Bull Terrier can look much the same – often so much the same that experts can't tell them apart. In fact, the same dog can be registered with the American Kennel Club as an American Staffordshire Terrier and also with the United Kennel Club as an American Pit Bull Terrier! So what's up with that? Well, these two breeds share exactly the same roots – a combination of tough working terriers and bulldogs brought to the U.S. from Great Britain in the late 1800s. They were used for dog-fighting and also as general farm dogs. In the 1930s, some breeders decided to focus on conformation shows where a standardized appearance was the most important goal. These lines of dogs became the American Staffordshire Terrier (AmStaff). Animal aggression was toned way down, and a more laid-back temperament is typical. Yes. It often surprises people to learn that this extremely muscular dog with the impressive, confident presence is so easygoing. A well-bred American Staffordshire Terrier is a dependable, good-natured, loyal companion. Athletic and agile, with finely tuned reflexes, he must have moderate daily exercise to maintain his splendid muscle tone. Companionship is even more important, and extensive ongoing socialization is paramount. His attitude toward strangers varies from exuberant face kissing to polite reserve. His attitude toward other animals, however, may be another story. Most lines are not particularly close to their dog-fighting ancestry, and many AmStaffs will live peacefully in a houseful of pets. But if confronted by another assertive dog, most AmStaffs will readily engage and then the results can turn deadly in a hurry. American Staffordshires can be stubborn, yet they respond well to confident owners who know how to establish and enforce rules of expected behavior. Because of public/media prejudice, every American Staffordshire Terrier should be trained through at least basic obedience and always leashed outside of his yard. Every well-behaved American Staffordshire seen on the street can help counteract anti-breed sentiment. If you want a dog who... An American Staffordshire Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An American Staffordshire Terrier may not be right for you.

To keep your American Staffordshire in, and to keep other animals out, fences should be at least six feet high. If you have a digger, sink wire into the ground along the fence line. Gates should have the highest quality locks. Frankly, the American Staffordshire Terrier may be ""too much dog"" for the average household."
American Water Spaniels," The AKC Standard says that the American Water Spaniel has ""great energy and eagerness for the hunt."" This solidly built breed is happy, hardy, and adaptable but also energetic and in need of a good amount of daily exercise. Swimming and fetching are especially appreciated. Too much confinement or isolation can lead to hyperactivity and destructive behavior. The temperament of the American Water Spaniel is about midway between that of an ingratiating English Springer Spaniel and a self-reliant Irish Water Spaniel. American Water Spaniels who have been extensively socialized are friendly. But many individuals make alert watchdogs and may not always welcome strangers into their home. Most are fine with other family pets, though some can be dominant with strange dogs. The American Water Spaniel is a bit of a challenge to train. He has a stubborn streak and is not as eager to please as some other spaniels. At the same time he is highly sensitive and may respond defensively if he thinks he is being treated unfairly (whether he actually is or not!) Consistent leadership is a must. If you want a dog who... An American Water Spaniel may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An American Water Spaniel may not be right for you.

Anatolian Shepherds," The rugged Anatolian Shepherd is not inclined to play fetch or Frisbee, nor should you expect animated responsiveness. Developed strictly for utilitarian purposes, as a guardian of livestock, the Anatolian Shepherd is typically serious and dignified, calm and quiet – unless challenged by an intruder (animal or human). Livestock guardians bond with flock animals (such as sheep) with fierce possessiveness. They make their own decisions about who is a friend and who is a foe, what is a threat and what is not, and they react to every situation as they see fit. Potential owners who don't have the experience to control these powerful instincts should look for another breed. Anatolian Shepherds are not casual pets. They are dominant, self-reliant dogs who will try to manage everyone and everything unless you are an assertive leader who knows how to instill respect. This breed requires a formal introduction to strangers before being touched by them, and he will remain vigilant every moment they are on his territory. He is patient with his own children and with submissive family pets. But he should not be expected to welcome those from outside his family. Despite his bulk, the Anatolian Shepherd Dog is remarkably agile and reactive. He needs a spacious yard with a six-foot-high fence that is extremely secure. If you want a dog who... An Anatolian Shepherd may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Anatolian Shepherd may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Anatolian Shepherd If I was considering an Anatolian Shepherd Dog, I would be most concerned about... Anatolian Shepherd Dogs are most satisfied when guarding livestock. You can substitute pulling a cart or sled, or advanced obedience, or tracking, or a similar canine activity. But if you simply want a casual pet for your family, I do not recommend this breed. Anatolians were never intended to be simply household pets. To keep your Anatolian Shepherd in, and to keep strangers and other animals out, fences should be high, with wire sunk into the ground along the fence line to thwart digging. Gates should have the highest quality locks."
Appenzeller Sennenhund (Mountain Dog)," Variously known as the Appenzeller Mountain Dog or Appenzeller Sennenhund, this bold and athletic breed enjoys romping and roughhousing, especially in the snow! This rugged and intelligent breed likes to keep busy and needs to have something to do. He is not an apartment dog. Pulling a cart or sled, herding, agility, fetching balls, playing Frisbee, and weight pulling are productive outlets for his energy. Appenzeller Mountain Dogs bond closely with their family and seek lots of attention. Their determination to jump up into your face or shove their body against your leg can be disconcerting to those who are not accustomed to an enthusiastic, vigorous dog. He likes children, but is likely to bowl over little ones. Appenzellers make vigilant watchdogs and will sound off in a loud, deep voice to announce visitors - or simply to let you know that your neighbor has stepped outdoors. Though polite with guests, the Appenzeller is the wariest of the Swiss mountain dog breeds. Early and ongoing socialization is essential to develop his stable, self-assured temperament. The Appenzeller Sennenhund can be dominant and pushy. These are necessary traits for a dog who must control unruly cattle, but challenging for nonassertive owners to handle. During adolescence, the Appenzell's hormones will kick in and he will start to test his limits. Thus, obedience training should start very early. Heeling is an especially important lesson, for these powerful dogs can literally pull you off your feet. If you want a dog who... An Appenzeller Mountain Dog may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Appenzeller Mountain Dog may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Appenzeller If I was considering an Appenzeller Mountain Dog, I would be most concerned about... I do not recommend this breed if you don't have the time or inclination to take your dog hiking or swimming or to the dog park, or to get involved in herding, or weight-pulling, or carting, or tracking, or agility (obstacle course), or advanced obedience, or a similar canine activity. Appenzellers were never intended to be simply household pets."
Dogo Argentino," Powerful, yet possessed of an almost feline grace, the Dogo Argentino (or Argentine Dogo) is fearless yet sensitive; energetic outdoors yet calm indoors. This impressive dog is best owned by active people who will develop his athletic abilities. He must have plenty of physical exercise to maintain his superb muscle structure and plenty of mental exercise to satisfy his desire to work and hunt. Despite his intimidating appearance, the Dogo Argentino is usually friendly, yet is also a vigilant guardian with a thunderous bark. Early socialization is an absolute requirement to build the stable, discriminating temperament this breed is known for. Though tough to the core, Dogos love to be petted. They crave close physical contact, leaning against you and lying on your feet. With his dog-fighting ancestry, dog aggression can be a problem. The Dogo Argentino should be thoroughly socialized with other dogs from an early age. He should not be kept with another dog of the same sex. With his strong prey drive, Dogos should not be kept with cats, either, unless raised with them. Strong-willed and independent, but also highly intelligent, the Dogo Argentino will respect an owner who is equally confident and consistent. Because of his hound heritage, the Dogo is constantly intrigued by the exciting smells around him, so you must work to keep his attention during training sessions. Note that this breed is banned or has ownership restrictions in a half-dozen countries.... If you want a dog who... An Dogo Argentino may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Dogo Argentino may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Dogo Argentino If I was considering a Dogo, I would be most concerned about... I do not recommend this breed if you simply want a pet for your family. You should have the time and inclination to take your Dogo running or hiking or swimming, not just for a few walks around the block. Ideally you would have an interest in a canine activity such as weight-pulling, or tracking, or agility (obstacle course), or advanced obedience, or schutzhund (protection). If you have children, I do not recommend an Dogo Argentino. Young Dogos (up to about two years old) can be bulls in a china shop. When they romp and jump, they do so with great vigor, and things can go flying, including people. In addition, Dogos may try to protect their own children from other children, which could lead to tragedy if kids are simply roughhousing and your Dogo decides to stop it. With such a massive dog, I wouldn't take the risk. Frankly, most Dogos are ""too much dog"" for the average household. This is a serious working dog with tremendous strength. Very few people really have the knowledge or skills necessary to manage this breed, or to provide the activities that keep him satisfied."
Australian Cattle Dogs,"Silver Dust Real Butter, Silver Dust AuCaDos The Australian Cattle Dog is also known as the Queensland Heeler – Queensland being a state in his native Australia, and Heeler referring his herding style of nipping at the heels of cattle in order to move them along. His color pattern can be blue-gray or red-gray, so you might also hear him called Blue Heeler or Red Heeler. Bold and athletic, the robust Australian Cattle Dog enjoys romping and roughhousing. He is absolutely NOT an apartment dog. To stay in hard muscular condition and a satisfied frame of mind, Queensland Heelers require lots of exercise. Working livestock, agility, jogging, biking, chasing balls, and playing Frisbee are productive outlets for this breed's high energy. Cooping him up with nothing to do will lead to destructive behaviors and obsessive barking. With strangers, the Cattle Dog is watchful and often suspicious. Early socialization is important so that he does not become too sharp. He can be dominant and pushy with other dogs, and with his strong chasing drives and tendency to nip at whatever he is pursuing, he is not recommended around cats unless raised with them. A challenging combination of cleverness and hard-headedness, Australian Cattle Dogs will test members of the family during adolescence and must be handled with firm, consistent leadership. These versatile dogs can learn and do a great deal in the right hands, but they will run right over hapless owners. If you want a dog who... An Australian Cattle Dog may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Australian Cattle Dog may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

I do not recommend this breed if you don't have the time or inclination to take your dog hiking or swimming, or to get involved in herding, or agility (obstacle course), or advanced obedience, or tracking, or a similar canine activity. Bored Cattle Dogs are famous for chewing through drywall, ripping the stuffing out of sofas, and turning your yard into a moonscape of giant craters.

Australian Kelpies," The lithe, hard-muscled Australian Kelpie can work stock for many hours and cover long distances in heat and dust without giving in. One of the smartest of all breeds, the Australian Kelpie can also be one of the most challenging to live with. His superior intellect, combined with his independence, intensity, and passion for keeping busy, are his best features – and the ones that make him unsuitable for most homes. This sharp-eyed, quick-thinking, fanatical workaholic must be allowed to do his job with livestock, to learn advanced obedience or agility, to accompany you jogging or biking, or to chase balls or Frisbees. Without physical and mental stimulation, Australian Kelpies become bored and hyperactive and will drive you crazy with obsessive, destructive behaviors as they seek creative outlets for their energy. High intelligence means they learn quickly – including how to do anything they set their mind to. They are master escape artists (going over and under fences) and zealous gatherers of cars, bikes, joggers, cats, other dogs, livestock, and running children – circling, poking, pushing, and nipping if the person or animal or object doesn't cooperate. You must stay one step ahead of this brilliant breed, and most people are simply not up to the task. If you want a dog who... An Australian Kelpie may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Australian Kelpie may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. If I were considering buying or adopting An Australian Kelpie If I was considering an Australian Kelpie, I would be most concerned about... Australian Kelpies were never intended to be simply household pets. Their working behaviors are inappropriate in a normal household setting. Trying to suppress these ""hardwired"" behaviors, without providing alternate outlets for their high energy level, is difficult-to-impossible. In other words, I don't recommend this breed if you simply want a pet for your family, and don't have the time or inclination to take your dog on long hikes and to get involved in herding, or agility (obstacle course), or advanced obedience, or a similar canine activity that keeps these super-intelligent dogs occupied."
Australian Shepherds," Australian Shepherds are quite variable in temperament. Some lines are extremely energetic, quick moving, and hyperreactive, while others tend toward a milder, calmer manner. Yet all Australian Shepherds need a great deal of physical exercise and mental stimulation. Herding, advanced obedience, agility, jogging or biking, chasing balls, and playing Frisbee are constructive outlets for their enthusiasm. Boredom is the leading cause of destructive behavior and barking. Australian Shepherds are demanding of time and attention and want to be with you constantly. They are polite to aloof with strangers. There is timidity in some lines, and early socialization is important to avoid shyness or sharpness. Some Australian Shepherds are dominant with other dogs and will chase cats, while others are good-natured with all creatures. One of the most capable breeds in all of dogdom, the Australian Shepherd excels at the highest levels of competition. Yet some are more challenging to train than others. The Miniature Australian Shepherd is exactly as its name implies: a small Aussie. Miniature Australian Shepherds can sometimes get by with less physical exercise than their full-size brothers, but need just as much mental stimulation. If you want a dog who... An Australian Shepherd may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Australian Shepherd may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Australian Shepherd If I was considering an Australian Shepherd, I would be most concerned about... If you want an easy-to-live-with pet who doesn't need much exercise and sleeps on the couch most of the day, this is not the breed for you. Unless you adopt an adult Aussie whose temperament is obviously mellow – yes, some Aussies are more mellow. But most want to run and hike and swim and play fetch games and participate in herding, or agility (obstacle course), or advanced obedience, or tracking, or a similar canine activity."
Australian Terriers," The AKC Standard calls him ""spirited, alert, courageous, and self-confident, with the natural aggressiveness of a ratter and hedge hunter."" One of the most sensible of the terriers, the Australian is nonetheless as hardy and spunky as the rest. To live happily with an Aussie (or any other terrier), you should fit certain criteria. You should understand the dynamic terrier temperament. You should have a fenced yard. And you should be able to provide sufficient daily companionship (no working all day), daily walks, and daily play sessions with a ball or toy. Though small, the Australian Terrier is an alert watchdog with keen senses. Most individuals are reserved/polite with strangers. Like all terriers, Aussies can be scrappy with other dogs of the same sex. But most individuals are willing to coexist peacefully with other pets. They can be bossy, though! And they're bred to pursue anything that runs or looks like prey, so keeping a pet hamster or rat would be a big risk! Quick to learn, an Aussie is mostly willing to please, though he definitely has his independent moments and must be taught who is in charge. As befits their heritage, some Australian Terriers are born diggers. Some can be barky, though in general this breed is quieter than many other terriers. If you want a dog who... An Australian Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Australian Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Australian Terrier If I was considering an Australian Terrier, I would be most concerned about... I do not recommend terriers for small children. Many terriers will not tolerate any nonsense from little life forms whom they consider to be below themselves in importance. Many terriers are quick to react to teasing, and even to the normal clumsiness that comes with small children (accidental squeezing of their ears or pulling of whiskers or stepping on their paw). Many terriers are possessive of their food and toys and will defend these from all comers, including children."
Basenjis," The AKC Standard says, ""Elegant and graceful, his whole demeanor is one of poise and inquiring alertness."" High-spirited and endlessly curious, the dapper, light-footed Basenji demands to be in on everything. Without enough physical and mental activity, he will become bored and then he may chew up your home or scale fences (sometimes trees) in search of a more interesting life. This dog is too busy and inquisitive to be left loose and unsupervised in your house or yard. Don't let him off the leash, for he is a swift, agile chaser who is impossible to catch. You must stay one step ahead of this thinking breed, for he uses his keen intelligence in clever, sometimes manipulative ways that suit his own purposes. Consistent leadership is a must. Basenjis are intriguing in that they are physically unable to bark. Yet they are still vigilant watchdogs due to their acute senses of sight and hearing, their wariness of strangers, their inherent distrust of anything new or different, and their territorial instincts. They will let you know when something is amiss. Though unable to make a barking sound, Basenjis are not silent dogs. They whine, growl, chortle, yodel – and scream. Yes. It's a sound that can get old really fast! If you want a dog who... A Basenji may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Basenji may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Basenji If I was considering a Basenji, I would be most concerned about... Try to get your Basenji involved in agility classes (an obstacle course for dogs) or in lure coursing (chasing a mechanized lure full-speed in a controlled setting). To teach your Basenji to listen to you, ""Respect Training"" is mandatory. My Basenji Training page discusses the program you need."
Basset Hounds," Basset Hounds are among the most pleasant-natured and easygoing of all breeds. Some are dignified, but most are clownish. Almost all are reliably good-natured, sociable, and peaceful with everyone – strangers, children, and other pets, too. At a dog show, one can count on seeing cheerfully wagging tails in the Basset Hound ring. However, this is not necessarily the easiest breed to live with or train! Many people are very surprised, when encountering a Basset Hound up close, at how bulky and heavy this breed really is. They may be short-legged, but Bassets weigh 50 or 60 pounds and need a moderate amount of daily exercise to stay fit, even if they appear to be content snoring in front of the fireplace. Lazy owners have fat Bassets with concurrent health problems. When you do take your Basset Hound outdoors, you need to keep him in a fenced area or on-leash. This is a hunting hound with a powerful nose and a yen for the chase, and if he picks up an interesting scent and launches himself, your shouting and arm waving will fall on totally deaf ears. ""Come"" is not a command that Basset Hounds are eager to obey. Indeed, Bassets are not eager to obey many commands. Stubborn and slow to obey (you should expect thoughtful, deliberate responses), the Basset Hound can exhibit an amusing sense of humor while doing his own thing. Yet he responds amiably to patient, consistent obedience training that includes lots of praise and encouragement. Basset Hounds live for food, which is why so many of them are fat. They are champion beggers, and will steal any tidbit within reach – and be forewarned that when they rear up on their hind legs, their reach includes countertops! Finally, Basset Hounds bay and howl (especially when bored), and they are notoriously slow to housebreak. If you want a dog who... A Basset Hound may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Basset Hound may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

To teach your Basset Hound to listen to you, I recommend ""Respect Training"" is mandatory. My Basset Hound Training Page discusses the program you need. Basset Hounds who don't get enough exercise can become obese, which puts additional stress on their bones and joints and causes more health problems. Basset Hounds need regular opportunities to stretch their legs in a safely enclosed area, like a dog park, if you want them to remain healthy and fit."
Beagles," Beagles are conveniently-sized, handsome and easy-to-groom, friendly with people, peaceful with other pets. And with their appealing soulful expression, it's perfectly natural that many people consider them as potentially wonderful pets. However, Beagles were developed as hunting hounds. They need much more exercise than most people give them, which is why you see so many fat Beagles. Though they're often kept in city apartments or condos, they should not be. Beagles require long frequent walks and a fenced yard where they can stretch their legs off-leash – FENCED because Beagles are explorers and chasers who will follow their nose wherever that fascinating sight or smell takes them. And since Beagles (like most hunting hounds) are endowed with selective deafness, they seldom come back when you call them. In addition, you can't leave them outside unmonitored, for Beagles are prone to wanderlust and can be adept climbers and diggers, i.e. escape artists. Also, Beagles left outside become bored and then they bay and howl and dig holes. One more thing..... most Beagles are chowhounds, so keep your trash cans out of reach and never set your plate of food down where he can get to it. The Beagle's vast stubbornness and distractability call for consistent and persistent training based on respect. Food rewards can be a great motivator for Beagles, but if you base all of your training on food, your Beagle will only obey when you have a cookie in your hand – obviously not a good situation. If you want a dog who... A Beagle may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Beagle may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of Beagles If I was considering a Beagle, I would be most concerned about... But Beagles should run inside an enclosed area like a yard or dog park. You shouldn't trust these dogs off-leash – they will follow their nose wherever it leads them and pursue anything that runs."
Bearded Collies," Lively, playful, and good-natured, this animated breed is famous for the ""Beardie Bounce"" – a bounding yo-yo leap that represents his happy, carefree attitude about the world. Some Bearded Collies are rowdier than others, but most tend to jump up into your face unless taught otherwise. This athletic dog needs a good amount of exercise to satisfy his high energy, especially when young. More urgently, he needs constructive activities (herding, hiking, agility, pet therapy, watching over other pets) to occupy his inquisitive mind. Beardies are very sociable dogs who can become unhappy and destructive if left for long periods of time without the companionship of people or other pets. Most individuals love everyone to the point where their ""watchdog"" bark is more welcome than warning. As with most sweet-natured tail-waggers, there is potential for timidity. Lots of socialization is necessary to develop the buoyant temperament. This independent thinker can be stubborn and requires a confident owner who will establish and enforce the rules. If you want a dog who... A Bearded Collie may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Bearded Collie may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Bearded Collie If I was considering a Bearded Collie, I would be most concerned about... But Bearded Collies don't need to be shaggy. You can shear or trim the coat so it's short, neat, and healthy. Problem solved!"
Beaucerons," This old French breed may look like a cross between a German Shepherd and a Doberman Pinscher or Rottweiler, but it is most definitely purebred! I've owned Beaucerons myself. This is a confident, steady-tempered, usually serious dog. Athletic and agile, he needs hard exercise (running, hiking, fetching). A walk around the block is most assuredly not enough. Too much confinement and too little exercise can lead to destructive behaviors and rambunctiousness, especially in youngsters. Mental exercise (advanced obedience, agility, herding, Schutzhund) is just as important to this highly intelligent breed. Matching his stern appearance, the Beauceron is usually keen-eyed and watchful, aloof and discriminating with strangers. Socialization must be early and frequent so that his watchfulness doesn't shade into suspiciousness or aggression. Shyness is unfortunately present in some lines. Most Beaucerons are territorial with other animals, but usually good with the pets in their own family, if raised with them. Beaucerons were bred to be herding dogs, so they might try to poke or push people and other animals – this is an attempt to move them along or gather them together. Indeed, Beaucerons like to control everyone and everything. They require a confident, consistent owner who knows how to lead. If you want a dog who... A Beauceron may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Beauceron may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Beauceron If I was considering a Beauceron, I would be most concerned about... I don't recommend this breed if you want a casual pet for your family. Beaucerons were never intended to be simply household pets. Get them involved in herding, or tracking, or agility (obstacle course), or advanced obedience, or schutzhund (protection), or carting, or a similar canine activity. They must have physical outlets for their energy and mental outlets for their intelligent minds. To teach your Beauceron to listen to you, ""Respect Training"" is mandatory. My Beauceron Training Page discusses the program you need."
Bedlington Terriers," If all you're looking at is the elegant body and lamblike coat, you might be surprised to discover how athletic the Bedlington Terrier truly is. Agile and graceful with a light, springy gait, the Bedlington Terrier needs access to a safe fenced area where he can play and dodge and gallop at the breathtaking speeds clearly suggested by his lithe build. Although milder-mannered and less rowdy indoors than most other terriers, once outdoors and aroused, the Bedlington changes from docile couch potato to dauntless explorer. Bright and clownish with his own family, his reaction to strangers varies from inquisitive to reserved; he needs early socialization so that caution does not become timidity. Bedlington Terriers are generally peaceful with other pets, though some can be scrappy with strange dogs. With his terrier heritage, one should expect that running animals will be chased. Bedlington Terriers can be stubborn, but do respond well to obedience training that is upbeat and includes lots of praise and food rewards. This sensitive breed should not be handled harshly or jerked around, nor does he meekly accept being teased by children. If you want a dog who... A Bedlington Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Bedlington Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

Belgian Shepherds,"Belgian Groenendael (aka Belgian Sheepdog), the longhaired black variety of Belgian Shepherd Belgian Shepherd Dogs come in four varieties: Most of the world, including the breed's own native country, consider the four varieties to be one breed called Belgian Shepherd Dog. Unfortunately the American Kennel Club has decided that the four varieties should be considered separate breeds. The AKC doesn't use the term Belgian Shepherd at all. Why is this so unfortunate? Because when varieties are considered different breeds, they're never bred together. That creates four small gene pools instead of one large one. Larger gene pools are much preferred for genetic diversity, and genetic diversity is very important for long-term health and vigor. To make matters even more confusing, the AKC re-named the Groenendael as Belgian Sheepdog! Which is just silly, since all four varieties are sheepdogs or shepherd dogs – none more so than another. Now.... on to temperament. The Belgian Shepherd is an extremely intelligent but challenging breed to live with. Athletic. Agile. Graceful. Elegant. The breed is frequently in motion, often moving in quick, light-footed circles. Sounds lovely, doesn't it? Ah but.... high energy means a lot of exercise is needed to stay in good condition. Even more important than physical exercise is mental exercise (advanced obedience, agility, herding, schutzhund, or tracking sports). Belgian Shepherds become bored, frustrated, and prone to obsessive behaviors without something to do. This is a demanding breed that needs ongoing supervision and structured activities. Belgian Malinois, shorthaired variety of Belgian Shepherd Sometimes playing the mischievous clown, yet more often serious, the Belgian Shepherd is highly observant with strangers, typically reserved and aloof, and has strong protective instincts. As such, Belgian Shepherds need more extensive socialization than most breeds so that their watchfulness doesn't become suspiciousness or sharpness. Shyness and spookiness are also present in a good number of Belgian Shepherd lines. Most Belgian Shepherds are okay with other pets if raised together. But dog-to-dog aggression is not uncommon and many individuals have a high prey drive and will pursue anything that moves. Small animals should be introduced with great care and supervision. Though extremely attentive and responsive to the direction of a confident owner, Belgian Shepherds can nonetheless prove difficult for an inexperienced owner to train. The breed is often sensitive to correction, so he requires a light hand on the leash.... BUT he also knows his own mind and can have dominant tendencies, so you must project firmness and leadership. The four varieties of Belgian Shepherd do have some differences in temperament (though these generalities don't apply to every individual). If you want a dog who... A Belgian Shepherd may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Belgian Shepherd may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Belgian Shepherd If I was considering a Belgian Shepherd, I would be most concerned about... Belgian Shepherds were never intended to be simply household pets. Their working behaviors (chasing, nipping, poking) are inappropriate in a normal household setting. Trying to suppress these ""hardwired"" behaviors, without providing alternate outlets for their high energy level, can be difficult. Belgian Tervuren, the longhaired brownish variety of Belgian Shepherd Frankly, most Belgian Shepherds (unless you adopt an obviously laid-back adult) are ""too much dog"" for the average household."
Bernese Mountain Dogs," The Bernese Mountain Dog is steady-tempered and easygoing. However, his calmness and willingness to laze about doesn't mean he can be cooped up without exercise. Indeed, the Bernese loves getting out, especially in cool weather. With his thick black coat, he doesn't do well in hot climates. Romping in the snow is a favorite form of recreation for this Alpine breed, and pulling carts and sleds is a wonderful source of exercise, especially if it involves children. His attitude toward strangers varies from friendly to aloof, but a good Bernese should remain poised and hold his ground. The most common temperament fault is excessive shyness, sometimes toward everyone, sometimes focused on one group of people, such as men with beards. A Bernese Mountain Dog puppy needs lots of socialization so that his natural caution does not become timidity. Most Bernese Mountain Dogs are peaceful and sociable with other animals. But some Bernese males are aggressive toward other male dogs. Responsive to obedience training in a slow, good-natured way, this sensitive breed should be handled kindly, with much praise and encouragement. However, they're not complete pushovers to train. Some can be a little bit hardheaded and dominant, especially males, and especially during adolescence when they're ""feeling their hormones."" There is great variability in size in this breed. Some individuals are medium/large and quite athletic, while others are huge and ponderous (especially males). If you want a dog who... A Bernese Mountain Dog may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Bernese Mountain Dog may not be right for you.

Bichon Frise," The AKC Standard calls the Bichon Frise ""a white powder puff of a dog whose merry temperament is evidenced by his plumed tail carried jauntily over the back and his dark-eyed inquisitive expression."" The Bichon Frise is pretty easy to live with. This cheerful, pleasant house dog enjoys playing games, snuggling into laps and pillows, and perching on the back of the sofa so he can peer out the window (and often BARK.... but we'll get to that!). Exercise needs are easy to meet: a daily walk or two, plus a small yard in which to trot around and stretch his legs. Bichons are peaceful with everyone, including other pets. There is timidity in some lines, so early socialization is important to develop their confidence. Though he does have an independent streak, the Bichon Frise is not a dominant dog. He responds well to training, though he prefers learning tricks to formal obedience and is especially bright-eyed when food treats are offered as rewards. Harshness only makes him spiteful. The three most common behavioral issues with the Bichon Frise are: If you want a dog who... A Bichon Frise may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Bichon Frise may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Bichon Frise If I was considering a Bichon Frise, I would be most concerned about... Instead, clip your Bichon's coat short so that brushing and combing is minimized. Then he will look like an adorable puppy throughout his life, and he can play in the dirt like every other dog. If the potential housebreaking problem sounds like a deal-breaker to you, don't give up! Consider adopting an already-housebroken adult Bichon Frise from a rescue group. Other concerns in the breed are urinary problems and bladder stones, along with loose knee joints that may require surgery, ear infections, cataracts, diabetes, heart disease. Read more about Bichon Frise Health."
Bloodhounds," The AKC Standard says, ""The expression is noble and dignified, and characterized by solemnity, wisdom, and power."" Though gentle and easygoing, even somewhat bumbling, the Bloodhound is not the lazy, lie-around dog he is often portrayed to be on TV. This big breed requires plenty of space and safe areas where he can romp and ramble every day. A leash and/or fence is mandatory, because if his tremendous nose locks on to a fascinating scent, his ears turn off and it is almost impossible to regain his attention. Bloodhounds will trail scents for miles and miles, until they are hit by a car. Though generally good-natured and gregarious with people and other animals, some individuals can be aggressive with other dogs of the same sex. His great strength and stubbornness call for a confident owner who knows how to enforce rules in an assertive (yet not harsh) manner. This kindly, sensitive breed should never be treated roughly. Bloodhounds are very slow to mature, so your patience and firmness need to extend over several years. His tendency to chew and swallow anything that fits in his mouth may send you both to the veterinary emergency room at some point. Some Bloodhounds are possessive of their food and toys, a potential problem around children and other pets. If you want a dog who... A Bloodhound may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Bloodhound may not be right for you.

Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Bloodhound If I was considering a Bloodhound, I would be most concerned about... Bloodhound owners should join their local tracking club and get their magnificent hounds involved in this potentially lifesaving activity. Bloodhounds were never intended to be simply household pets. Their working behaviors (following scents, chasing things that run, exploring, baying) can be a nuisance in a normal household setting. Trying to suppress these ""hardwired"" behaviors, without providing alternate outlets for their energy, is pretty nigh impossible. Also unfair to the dog.

Bolognese," The Bolognese belongs to a related family of dogs that include the Bichon Frise, Maltese, Havanese, and Coton de Tulear. All of these breeds have a similar appearance and temperament. Of the group, some breeders believe that the Bolognese is the brightest thinker and problem solver. He is also, by far, the hardest of those breeds to find. Devoted and attentive, the Bolognese shadows his owner and is such a skilled reader of body language and expression that he often appears telepathic. Indeed, this breed doesn't do well without a great deal of companionship. If you're home all day and looking for a lap buddy, consider this breed. Otherwise, the dog will be lonely and unhappy. Quick to learn and responsive to gentle training, some Bolognese do well in competitive obedience and agility. If you want a dog who... A Bolognese may be right for you.

Border Collies," This working farm dog is famous for his intimidating ""eye"" – a fixed, hypnotic stare as he crouches low and creeps up on the sheep. One of the most intelligent of all breeds, the Border Collie is also one of the most challenging to live with. His superior intellect, combined with his intensity and obsessive zeal for working, are his most impressive features – and also the ones that make him unsuitable for most homes. This sharp-eyed, quick-thinking, fanatical workaholic has been bred for endless miles of sprinting and stop-and-go action. If it isn't possible for him to work livestock, you must substitute several LONG (45 minute) walks per day, plus off-leash romps in a safe area like a dog park. Plus fetching balls or frisbee. Plus weekly classes in advanced obedience or agility (obstacle course for dogs). Yes, this is a lot! Without physical and mental stimulation, Border Collies become hyperactive and will drive you up the wall with obsessive and destructive behaviors as they seek creative outlets for their physical and mental energy. High intelligence does mean they learn very quickly - but that includes learning how to do anything they set their minds to. They are master escape artists who can virtually pick the lock on your gate. Trying to train a Border Collie, in fact, can be frustrating, because they are constantly thinking, analyzing, and reacting to every tiny movement you make. They can be a bit high-strung and oversensitive to sound and touch. Border Collies are passionate gatherers of cars, bikes, joggers, cats, other dogs, livestock, deer, and running children – poking, pushing, and nipping if the pursued person or animal or object doesn't cooperate. You must stay one step ahead of this challenging breed, and most households are simply not up to the task. If you want a dog who... A Border Collie may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Border Collie may not be right for you.

Throw their ball over and over and over. They must have physical outlets for their energy and mental outlets for their intelligent minds. Trying to suppress their ""hardwired"" working behaviors, without providing alternate outlets for their high energy level, is virtually impossible and not fair to the dog. Some Border Collies use their intelligence to coax you into doing what they want – yes, they might out-think you! Some Border Collies are so sensitive that if your training techniques aren't close to perfect, they may freeze and ""shut down."" Some Border Collies are hyper-reactive to the slightest sound or movement you make; they are ""anticipators"" who keep trying to guess what comes next instead of paying attention to what you actually want. See Border Collie Training. I hope you can see that most Border Collies are ""far too much dog"" for the average household. This is a dedicated working dog with a complex personality and special needs. It's difficult to keep this breed satisfied and well-behaved."
Border Terriers," Inside your home, the Border Terrier is milder-mannered than most terriers. Yet in the field, hunting small animals, he is described as ""hard as nails, game as they come, and driving in attack."" Some individuals are more work-oriented (not good pets) while others are more mellow (can be good pets if their other needs are met). In general the Border Terrier is energetic and athletic. He tends to play rough and prefers vigorous exercise and interactive games. But he should not be let off-leash, for there is no terrier more determined to explore and pursue anything that runs (except, perhaps, for the Jack Russell). Border Terriers are so inquisitive they often get themselves wedged into tight holes or crawlspaces trying to find out what's in there. A secure yard or kennel run is essential for this breed, unless you adopt a more laid-back adult who has already proven himself to stay put and not try to escape. Most Border Terriers who have been extensively socialized are bouncy and kissy with strangers, though there is timidity in some lines. Unlike most terriers, the Border is usually sociable with other dogs and not given to fiery posturing. But he may or may not live peacefully with the family cat, and he is a business-like hunter of anything else. Generally willing to please and sensitive to correction, the Border Terrier responds nicely to training that includes a lot of praise and encouragement. Motivate with food in moderation – Borders live for food and can become pudgy if over-indulged. If you want a dog who... A Border Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with...

To teach your Border Terrier to listen to you, ""Respect Training"" is mandatory. My Border Terrier Training Page discusses the program you need. I do not recommend terriers for homes with very young children. Many terriers will not tolerate any nonsense from little life forms whom they consider to be below themselves in importance. Many terriers are quick to react to teasing, and even to the normal clumsiness that comes with small children (accidental squeezing of their ears or pulling of whiskers or stepping on their paw). Many terriers are possessive of their food and toys and will defend these from all comers, including children."
Borzois," Possessed of a quiet dignity and independence, the Borzoi is sometimes compared to a cat – a very tall cat! Once past the boisterous puppy stage, most Borzois are calm and quiet indoors, gliding through your living room with light-footed grace. Off-leash, though, the Borzoi can explode into a powerful, driving, floating gallop. Therefore the space where he is loosed to run must be safe and enclosed, else he will be out of sight in seconds. Breeders say one of the leading causes of death in Borzois is being hit by a car. With strangers, most Borzois are polite but reserved. Because of their great size and strength, they require early socialization to avoid either aggression (very rare) or skittishness/shyness (more common). Usually sociable with other dogs of their own size, the Borzoi is a deadly serious chaser of anything that runs, including cats and small dogs. Once known as Russian Wolfhound, this breed can easily dispatch almost any smaller animal. Like all sighthounds, Borzoi are independent and not inclined to obey slavishly. Though usually sweet and docile, this breed can be touch-sensitive and may react with lightning reflexes if grabbed unexpectedly or startled. This is a not a breed to be taken lightly or teased. If you want a dog who... A Borzoi may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Borzoi may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

See if there is a dog club in your area that offers an activity called lure coursing, which is chasing a mechanical lure in a controlled setting. This is an appropriate outlet for the full-speed galloping behaviors that are ""hardwired"" into your Borzoi's genes. In today's society, the legal liabilities of owning a large powerful hunting breed should always be kept in mind."
Boston Terriers," Boston Terriers are very individualistic: Some are high-spirited and clownish, while some are calm and dignified, even placid. Some are stubborn characters, while others are sweet and gentle. But in general, the Boston Terrier is an altogether dapper and charming little dog. Playing games and chasing balls are (typically) two of his passions. Seeking companionship is another, for the Boston always wants to be with his family. His large expressive eyes, attentively cocked head, and snorting and snuffling sounds bring out parental feelings in many people. Extremely sensitive to his owner's moods, some Boston Terriers are one-person dogs, with a special affinity for the elderly. But many are outgoing with everyone, and even the ones who are a bit standoffish are polite. Yet he is a dependable watchdog who will let you know when someone is at the door. Fine with other family pets, Boston Terriers may put on a blustery show upon spying a larger dog across the street, but they are seldom truly aggressive. This breed is often a good choice for first-time owners – as long as you can deal with the health issues resulting from their unnaturally short face. If you want a dog who...

Bouvier des Flandres," The Bouvier des Flandres tends to be sober and thoughtful, rather than light-hearted or whimsical. The AKC Standard calls him ""steady, resolute, and rugged."" Though they can be athletic and agile, many Bouviers (especially those from show lines) are a bit lazy unless deliberately taken outside and encouraged to move. Brisk walks are a must to keep them in hard condition. Mental stimulation in the form of advanced obedience, agility, tracking, herding, carting, or Schutzhund is even more important to this highly intelligent breed. But there is a big difference between Bouviers from working lines and those from show lines. If you're not going to devote serious time with your dog in some form of ""working activity"", don't get a Bouvier from working lines. Though not overly demonstrative – he shows his loyalty in more subtle ways – the Bouvier des Flandres must live indoors and close to his family, his ""flock."" Matching his stern appearance (often likened to a wise old grandfather), he is often aloof with strangers. His air of calm appraisal can be intimidating, although he is more likely to use his big body to control people, rather than biting. Socialization must be early and frequent so that he learns to discriminate between friend and foe. Most Bouvers des Flandres are dominant with other dogs, especially of the same sex. Individuals with a high prey drive are not reliable with cats and other creatures that run or flutter. Make no mistake about it, the Bouvier des Flandres can be a pushy, strong-willed dog who requires a confident owner, especially during the challenging adolescent period. This is not a breed for first-time or passive owners. If you want a dog who... A Bouvier des Flandres may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with...

Boxer Dogs," Boxers can be fine family dogs if you can proviide enough exercise and training to control their rambunctiousness when young, and if you can provide for their special needs due to their unnaturally short face. As puppies and young adults, Boxers are animated, playful (often cuckoo!) dogs who love to romp and jump. Middle-aged Boxers typically become more deliberate and dignified and make calm, loyal companions for the rest of their (unfortuntately not very long) lives. Exercise needs vary from long daily walks for more sedentary Boxers to vigorous daily romping for high-energy individuals – but not in hot weather, because Boxers are more susceptible to heatstroke than most dog breeds.  Though most Boxer dogs are fine with other family pets, including the family cat, quite a few Boxers are dominant or aggressive toward other dogs of the same sex, and some are cat chasers. Boxers need consistent leadership. Their heritage, after all, is that of a strong-minded working dog. But you must handle them in an upbeat, persuasive way. Boxers are stubborn, yes, but also sensitive and proud. They will ""shut down"" (sulk and pout and passively refuse to do anything) if you jerk them around. Most Boxers make vigilant watchdogs – meaning they will bark when they see or see something out of the ordinary. Their guarding and territorial instincts, though, vary a great deal. Most Boxers react to strangers with a joyous ""Hi, come on in!"" accompanied by enthusiastic jumping and tail-stump wiggling. Other Boxers are more standoffish, neither fawning over strangers nor threatening them. A few Boxers (typically those from German lines) are more forceful and challenging. Early socialization is important to develop a stable attitude in your Boxer. If you want a dog who... A Boxer may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Boxer may not be right for you.

Prospective Boxer owners should be aware that they might be taking on expensive health problems over their dog's lifetime. Read more about Boxer Health."
Briards," Vigorous and spirited in body, independent and purposeful in mind, the Briard can be serious (""a reserved philosopher"") or a humorous clown. His light, supple gait, like that of a large feline, has been described as ""quicksilver,"" permitting him to make the springing starts, abrupt turns, and sudden stops required of a shepherd dog. Athletic and agile under that long coat, the Briard needs some hard exercise each day. Mental exercise (herding, agility, tracking) is just as important to this thinking breed. Matching his stern appearance, he is aloof and discriminating with strangers, keen-eyed and watchful. Socialization must be early and frequent so that his watchfulness does not shade into aggression or shyness. Spookiness is unfortunately present in some lines. Most Briards are territorial with other animals, but usually good with the pets in their own family, if raised with them. You should discourage his habit of poking or pushing people and other pets with his huge, powerful head in an attempt to keep them within boundaries. Briards like to control situations and require a confident, consistent owner who knows how to lead. However, they are very sensitive (sometimes overly so) and must be treated with a light hand. This breed has a long memory and doesn't easily forgive or forget harsh handling. If you want a dog who... A Briard may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Briard may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

Brittanys," The American Kennel Club calls this breed a Brittany, while in other countries it's called Brittany Spaniel. The disagreement stems from the breed's hunting style being more like a pointer or setter than a spaniel, and yet his appearance resembles a spaniel. Therefore I say it both ways. Conveniently-sized, athletic, and agile, the Brittany loves being with you in the Great Outdoors. He thrives with an active lifestyle of very long walks, hiking in the woods, and fetch games. If left alone too much and not given outlets for his energy, you're likely to see hyperactivity, barking, and destructive chewing. When well socialized, most Brittany Spaniels are polite and gentle with everyone and peaceful with other animals. But there is timidity and excessive submissiveness in some lines, so early socialization is a must to promote a confident temperament. Most Brittanys are sensitive dogs with a rather ""soft"" temperament. They respond best to a calm voice and a light hand on the leash and do not do well in an environment with frequent tension or loud voices. Some Brittanys, especially adolescents, are excessively submissive. These dogs might suddenly urinate (or dribble urine) when they get over-excited or feel intimidated. This might simply be someone's hand reaching to pet them, or your body looming over them during play. This is not a housebreaking issue! It's called excitable or submissive urination and it might go away with time as long as you don't punish the dog. Some Brittany Spaniels tend to whine persistently. If you want a dog who... A Brittany Spaniel may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Brittany may not be right for you.

Brussels Griffons," Often described as ""full of self-importance,"" the terrier-like Brussels Griffon is happy, spunky, spirited, and comical. His adept climbing skills, coupled with his curiosity and imagination, can get him into trouble. Be watchful that he does not end up too high, where he could fall and break his neck. An alert watchdog, the Brussels Griffon may become friendly with guests or he may be cautious or even shy with new people and new situations. Socialization is a must to promote a confident, stable temperament. Most Brussels Griffons are fine with other family pets, but if they perceive an invasion of their space by a strange dog, they can display great ferocity, though it is mostly bluff and bluster. This is not an eager-to-please breed! The Brussels Griffon has a clever mind of his own and without a firm hand can be demanding and manipulative. Training him to walk calmly on a leash may take time and patience, for he can be obstinate and may pitch a fit of acrobatic leaping and flinging himself about. If you can chuckle at some of his eccentricities yet remain firm about the general rules of the household, the Brussels Griffon is very pleasant and entertaining to live with. Like most breeds of terrier heritage, he is proud and sensitive and may become defensive if handled harshly or teased. This is not a breed for very small children. Gabby at 12 years old, beloved companion of Ellie Holzhauer If you want a dog who... A Brussels Griffon may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with...

Brussels Griffons are not suited to young children, no matter how well-meaning the child. Children cannot help being clumsy, and that a child meant well is little solace to a Brussels Griffon who has been accidentally stepped on, sat on, rolled on, squeezed, or dropped onto the patio. Many Brussels Griffons feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making – and stress and fearfulness (even defensive biting) may be the result.

English Bulldogs," Most breed clubs call this breed simply Bulldog. But he is also referred to as English Bulldog  or British Bulldog  to distinguish him from other bulldog-type breeds such as the French Bulldog or American Bulldog. The AKC Standard says the disposition of the English Bulldog should be ""equable and kind, resolute and courageous.... demeanor should be pacific and dignified."" In other words, the English Bulldog is one of the most amiable of all breeds. Despite his gloomy mug. Bulldog puppies are frisky, but adults are quiet and rather phlegmatic, spending much of the day snoring on the sofa. But they definitely need some exercise to stay fit, preferably walks in cool weather. Some English Bulldogs are friendly with strangers, while others are politely reserved. Though not a barking watchdog, his blocky build and his rolling, shuffling gait give intruders pause. It takes a tremendous amount of serious teasing or threatening to provoke this sweet-natured breed, but once aroused, he can be a force to reckon with. His tenacity and resolve mean that it's difficult to change his mind once he decides to do something. Usually peaceful with other pets, some male Bulldogs may engage in a battle of wills (or jaws) with other males. Though stubborn, the English Bulldog is surprisingly sensitive, remembers what he learns, and responds well to patient, persistent training. If you want a dog who...

To teach your Bulldog to listen to you, see English Bulldog Training. Be aware that English Bulldogs can be very possessive of their food bowl. Don't feed an English Bulldog in the presence of other animals. Children should also be kept away, just to be safe. Honestly? I don't recommend buying an English Bulldog puppy, as that only encourages people to keep breeding unhealthy puppies. If you really want this breed, please consider adopting an adult Bulldog who desperately needs a home. Provide the best life you can for him, managing his health problems as they occur. You can ward off some health issues by following the advice on my Bulldog Health Page."
Bullmastiffs," Though usually mild-mannered, the powerful Bullmastiff is also serious and self-assured. He is afraid of nothing, and once aroused will seldom back down. Bullmastiff puppies (up to two or three years old) can be rambunctious and have an aversion to keeping all four feet on the ground at the same time. Fortunately, adults are calm and quiet and need only moderate exercise to maintain their impressive muscle tone. This breed is intensely loyal to his family and doesn't like being left outside. If he doesn't get enough companionship or personal attention, he may walk through fences just to be with people. Though sensible with strangers, the Bullmastiff does have well-established protective and territorial instincts. He must be thoroughly socialized at an early age so that he learns to distinguish friend from foe. He can be aggressive with other dogs of the same sex, and though he may be fine with the family cat, strange animals will not be accepted onto his property. Tremendously strong and stubborn, Bullmastiffs are inclined to do things their own way and will test members of the family. However, he will respond to early, consistent obedience training that includes leadership, cheerful praise, and food rewards. Overall, he's a splendid, capable companion for assertive owners, but without ongoing time and effort, socialization and supervision, he is too much to handle. If you want a dog who...

English Bull Terriers," There is a Standard Bull Terrier (medium-sized) and a Miniature Bull Terrier (mid-sized) that are considered separate breeds. But they have similar temperaments: sweet-tempered, yet also rowdy and clownish, full of fire and determination. This muscular, forceful, vigorous dog does best with active families, for he has a high energy level that comes in spurts and bursts. He needs frequent brisk walks, occasional vigorous games of ball, and total immersion in the family, i.e. LOTS of companionship and interactive play sessions. If ignored, Standard and Miniature Bull Terriers will become bored, and mischief will surely follow. Youngsters who are neglected can be especially rambunctious: happily devouring your furniture and excavating great caverns in your yard. Most Bullies greet strangers with enthusiastic bounding (often knocking the guest over) and face kissing. However, aggression and timidity are present in some lines, and early socialization is important to develop a stable attitude. An English Bull Terrier should not be kept with another dog of the same sex, and cats may or may not be safe. Bull Terriers can be very possessive of their food – do not allow another pet or a child to approach a Bull Terrier when he is eating.. At some point, if you have not raised this breed with consistent leadership, he will likely challenge your ability to control his actions. Such dominance attempts must be met with calm assertiveness. Keep training sessions brief but frequent to keep drilling home the commands he needs to learn. Some Bull Terriers are enthusiastic ""talkers"" who grunt and mumble to themselves; it's quite amusing.

Cairn Terriers," Are you old enough to remember Toto, the brave little terrier in The Wizard of Oz? Toto was a Cairn Terrier. Befitting his breed, Toto was everything a terrier was designed to be – sturdy, plucky, hardy, spirited. ""He stands up on his toes"", is an old saying about terriers in general. The Cairn Terrier loves to play and needs his daily walks. But he is adaptable to any home in which he can be a full participant and busybody and where his bold terrier traits are kept under control by a confident owner. Adult Cairn Terriers may be friendly or reserved with strangers, but are always alert and quick to announce guests. This breed can be scrappy and bossy with other pets, but will co-exist with them more readily than some other terriers. However, strange animals may be a different story, as the Cairn Terrier was bred to hunt and will chase anything that moves. He is inquisitive, so a leash or fenced yard is essential at all times. Assertive but cheerful, with typical terrier stubbornness, the Cairn Terrier must be shown that you are in charge. But he does respond well to consistent discipline and lots of praise. Cairn Terriers can be possessive of their food and toys. And being respectable terriers, they are enthusiastic diggers and barkers. If you want a dog who... A Cairn Terrier may be right for you.

Canaan Dogs," The AKC Standard says, ""The Canaan Dog moves with athletic agility and grace, with a quick, brisk, ground-covering trot."" The Canaan Dog is light-footed and can turn on a dime, making him a natural for agility classes where dogs must race nimbly over a canine obstacle course. However, this assumes that you have the skills to train him! Canaan Dogs are independent thinkers who resist repetitious training, which they find boring. Motivate them with variation, praise, and occasionally food. They may also test you for pack leadership, so they require a confident, consistent owner. The Canaan Dogs retains many ""primitive dog"" instincts. For example, he makes a vigilant watchdog due to his keen senses, his wariness of strangers, his territorial instincts, and his distrust of anything new or different. He is 100 percent aware of his surroundings, constantly observing and listening. He will sound the alarm at every perceived threat. This tends to be a vocal breed – barking and whining may need to be controlled. Also be aware that a watchdog is not the same thing as a guard dog. The Canaan Dog is not aggressive toward people. Rather, he reacts to a stranger's intrusion into his territory defensively – by retreating just out of reach and barking continuously. Because caution can easily shade into shyness and fearfulness, early and extensive socialization is required to build a confident, stable temperament. Dog to dog aggression can be a problem in some Canaan Dogs, as can chasing smaller animals. A strong prey drive is another primitive instinct. Also digging – another primitive instinct you need to be aware of if you have flower gardens. Finally, this independent dog is self-reliant and doesn't need constant petting. What he DOES need is plenty of mental stimulation such as advanced obedience training, agility, tracking, herding (yes, a well-bred Canaan Dog has herding instincts). This intelligent dog is an excellent problem-solver and if you don't keep him occupied, he will become bored, which can lead to destructiveness. Canaan Dogs will take as much exercise as you can offer, yet adults are calm enough to curl up on the sofa when the day's work or fun is over. If you want a dog who... A Canaan Dog may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Canaan Dog may not be right for you.

Cane Corsos," When it comes to athleticism, agility, speed, energy level, and sense of adventure, the Cane Corso (CAH-nay COR-so)  easily outdoes the other mastiff breeds. This robust dog needs his share of exercise, but above all he requires personal interaction and lots of companionship. He lives for his family and may become destructive if left alone too much. Cane Corso puppies should be friendly and trusting with strangers. With proper socialization, they become more aloof and discerning as they mature. As with all mastiffs, socialization is an absolute requirement to promote the correct temperament, which should be protective in a calm and discriminating way. Unfortunately, an awful lot of people are breeding or raising these dogs in irresponsible ways and the result is an awful lot of Cane Corsos with unstable or aggressive temperaments that can be dangerous to innocent people. Though the Cane Corso was not used for dog-fighting, dog aggression (often very serious) can still be a problem. He should be thoroughly socialized with other dogs from an early age. I wouldn't keep a Cane Corso with another large dog of the same sex. The Cane Corso is more attentive to his owner and more responsive to training than other mastiffs. Though quite dominant and strong-willed, he will respect an owner who is confident and consistent. Cane Corsos have tighter skin than other mastiffs and drool less. Some love to dig holes, and most enjoy splashing in water, whether it be a pond or a mudhole, the lawn sprinkler or their water bowl. These are not dainty dogs for fastidious housekeepers! If you want a dog who... A Cane Corso may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Cane Corso may not be right for you.

Cardigan Welsh Corgis," Spirited and athletic, steady and dependable, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi is a big dog on short legs. By that I mean his body is more heavily-boned and stronger than you might think, and also his temperament is that of a larger dog. Corgis were developed as herding dogs, darting beneath the kicks of unruly cattle and biting at their heels to move them along. So they are tough working dogs! If you don't have cattle, you can substitute ball-playing games as an enjoyable outlet for their enthusiasm and desire to work. If his days include such moderate exercise, along with the companionship of his family, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi is adaptable and easy to live with. He is polite with guests, reserved with strangers, and makes a sensible watchdog. Corgis do bark, be forewarned. Often too much! Most are fine with other family pets, including livestock and horses. But he tends to be territorial with strange dogs and cats. One of his responsibilities as a farm dog was to chase strays away from his own farm. This bright breed learns quickly. But he has the independent mindset of a true herding breed, so you must have the confidence to establish and consistently enforce rules, else he will make up his own. His close cousin, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is generally considered easier to train than the Cardigan. Like most herding breeds, Corgis prefer their flock (family members and other pets) to be gathered together and may try to accomplish this by circling and nipping. If you want a dog who... A Cardigan Welsh Corgi may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Cardigan Welsh Corgi may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

More traits and characteristics of the Cardigan Welsh Corgi If I was considering a Cardigan Welsh Corgi, I would be most concerned about... I recommend that you get your Cardigan Welsh Corgi involved in regular obedience classes (beyond the beginners level – join a dog club and go every week). Also consider agility classes (an obstacle course for dogs) or even herding, if there is a herding club in your area. Also consider my book, Teach Your Dog 100 English Words, because teaching your dog words and games stimulates his brain and keeps him happy!"
Cavalier King Charles Spaniels,"Australian Ch. Kahleyvale Colourmyworld (Tilly) Often called a ""sporting toy breed"" because of his combination of spaniel and toy traits, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is sweet-tempered, playful, and gentle. This comfort-loving breed adores cuddling in laps and snuggling on soft pillows, but he also has more athletic instincts than you might think. Indeed, he can be a runner and chaser. A fenced yard or a leash are musts at all times, because many Cavaliers will pursue squirrels, chipmunks, low-flying birds, even butterflies, right into the street. Cavaliers do need a decent amount of exercise – a couple of long daily walks and definitely a fenced yard in which to run. Otherwise they will become fat and lethargic. Just as importantly, this breed is VERY dependent on human conpanionship. They need companionship most of the day and become stressed when left alone too long. Separation anxiety is a real problem with Cavaliers. , so should have companionship (either human or other pets) most of the day. A Cavalier who is lonely will whine or bark or chew destructively. Most Cavaliers are polite with everyone and peaceful with other dogs and cats. As with all sweet-tempered dogs, there is potential for timidity, so Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppies need plenty of early socialization to build a confident, outgoing temperament. Though they do have an independent streak, Cavaliers are soft-tempered dogs who are willing to please. They respond well to cheerful training – as long as they respect you. If you want a dog who...

Cesky Terriers," Though short-legged, the Cesky Terrier is NOT a small dog. His long body is much heavier and more substantial than you might think. The rugged, persistent Cesky Terrier has more hunting instincts than some other terriers. When he is outdoors, his large inquisitive nose is usually glued to the ground in search of prey that he can chase and kill. But indoors he is calm and laid-back, with a sweet disposition toward his family and other pets. Given moderate exercise in a safely enclosed yard or dog parkand given lots of personal attention (he doesn't like being left alone for long periods), the Cesky Terrier can fit into a small city home as readily as a sprawling country estate. With strangers, Cesky Terriers are usually reserved but polite, though early socialization is a must to develop this attitude. With other dogs and cats, he is more sociable than most terriers. Squirrels and other rodents, however, will be chased with determination. Though he has his stubborn, independent streak, he responds pretty well to training that includes lots of praise and a few treats. Just go easy on the treats so that he doesn't pack on weight. This may be easier said than done, as he tends to be a food thief whose long reach, when standing on his hind legs, can result in the birthday cake vanishing off the kitchen countertop. And unfortunately, it isn't only food that Cesky Terriers like to eat. They are noted for swallowing inedible objects, which may lead to a frantic night in the veterinary emergency room.

Chesapeake Bay Retrievers," The Chesapeake Bay is the most powerful of the retrievers, with the strongest personality. This rugged dog should be taken hiking and swimming as often as possible. A walk around the block is not nearly enough to maintain his muscle tone or to satisfy his working instincts. This breed needs a job to do (learning obedience exercises, fetching a stick or ball, canine fieldwork), else he will find his own ways to keep himself busy, and you may not appreciate his choices. Unlike the more popular Labrador and Golden Retrievers, the Chesapeake is intensely loyal to his family, reserved with strangers, and possessed of good discriminatory instincts. Thus he makes a fine watchdog, but is not usually aggressive toward strangers. Most Chesapeake Bay Retrievers are fine with the pets in their own family, but can be territorial with strange dogs and cats. As with all retrievers, you must control his tendency to chew on objects and to mouth your hands. Provide a box filled with toys so he can carry something around in his mouth if he wants to. Confident leadership and obedience training are required to develop respect. Chesapeakes will test members of the family to find his place in the pecking order. If you don't take the top position, he will. If you want a dog who... A Chesapeake Bay Retriever may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with...

Chihuahuas,"  Smooth Coat Chihuahua with a bright expression Chihuahuas are comical, entertaining, expressive, and loyal little dogs. They burrow under blankets, dance on their hind legs, wave their paws in the air, and lick everything in sight. Chihuahuas are absolutely brimming with personality – often a quirky and eccentric personality unmatched by any other breed. Other than that generalization, Chihuahuas are extremely variable. You can find individuals who are lively or placid. Bold or timid. Feisty or mellow. Confident or nervous. Stubborn or eager to please. How a Chihuahua turns out depends very much on the genetic temperament of his parents and grandparents. In other words, entire lines of Chihuahuas are social or antisocial. If you bring home an individual who has inherited genes for a bad temperament.... well, let's just say that's not a wise thing to do unless you're prepared to live with an unstable dog. Socialization and training often can't overcome bad genes in a Chihuahua. But socialization and training ARE still extremely important! As long as your Chihuahua has inherited genes for a normal temperament, how you raise him will determine how he turns out. Chihuahuas do not have a particularly good reputation among the general public. Ask a few people, ""Do you think Chihuahuas are nice dogs?"" and see how many of them exclaim, ""No! They're mean and nasty and they bite!"" Sadly, this reputation has some basis in truth. So many people stupidly breed two Chihuahuas whose temperaments are not good. Then their puppies inherit genes for a bad temperament. Duh. Other people take a perfectly good Chihuahua and treat him like a stuffed toy or doll, or as a substitute for a human infant. They carry him everywhere in their arms, which essentially tells the dog that the world is unsafe for him to walk through. Or they don't teach any commands, laugh at signs of aggression, make excuses for bad behavior, and soothe and coo over the dog constantly. It's no wonder that so many Chihuahuas are neurotic when they're made that way by their owners. Spoiling is a dreadful way to raise a dog; all it does is make the owner feel good, while creating an insecure dog who barks manically whenever he sees something that looks or sounds unfamiliar. What an awful state of mind for that dog to live with. Long Coat Chihuahuas – a black and a chocolate. On a chocolate Chihuahua, even the nose is chocolate brown. All dogs, whatever their size, should be taught how to walk on their own four feet, how to do what they're told, and how to get along peacefully with the world. This creates a confident, stable Chihuahua. Now, you do need to take precautions! There are indeed dangers lurking everywhere for toy dogs. The trick is to let your Chihuahua walk on his own as much as possible, while still keeping an eagle eye out for real danger. If you don't protect his safety, he can be hurt or killed, but if you baby him and don't require him to be well-behaved, he can end up insecure or downright nasty Chihuahuas adore warmth, oh, yes! They will seek out the tiniest sunspot in which to bask blissfully. They also burrow under blankets and tunnel under towels. You need to be careful whenever you sit down on your sofa or bed, as there could be a Chihuahua tucked under there. Why do Chihuahuas shiver or tremble so much? Well, they might be a little cold, but usually they quiver when they're either nervous or excited. The most difficult thing to teach a Chihuahua? Housebreaking. Chihuahuas are VERY difficult to housebreak – one of the most difficult of all breeds – especially in cold or wet weather. In cold or rainy climates, consider an indoor litter box, or a doggy door that leads out to a covered potty area.   Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament  is less predictable than the inheritance of physical  traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training.

Some Long Coat Chihuahuas have a bushy coat, while with others (such as these three lovelies), you can only tell they're longhaired by the tufts of hair near their ears. According to the official breed clubs, Chihuahuas should be about 5-9 inches at the shoulder and weigh 2-6 lbs. But some individuals are smaller, and many individuals are larger – often twice as large. You might have heard of a Teacup Chihuahua? a Tiny Toy Chihuahua? an Extreme Tiny Chihuahua? Those phrases are made-up. There is no such breed or variety as a Teacup Chihuahua, or any of the other names. They're simply marketing phrases used by clever breeders who want you to think you're getting some kind of extra-special Chihuahua.... one for which you will pay through the nose. Such a breeder might tell you that ""Toy"" Chihuahuas are a certain weight range, ""Tiny Toy"" Chihuahuas are slightly smaller, ""Extreme Tiny"" Chihuahuas are smaller than that, etc. These breeders might even price their dogs according to weight, as if that should define a dog's value. And their prices are typically ridiculous. There are NO weight divisions in this breed. It is perfectly natural for one individual to weigh more or less than another. Whether an individual weighs 2 lbs or 6 lbs or 12 lbs, he's still a Chihuahua, which is a Toy breed. All Chihuahuas are Toys. Unfortunately, Chihuahuas under 2 or 3 lbs are at greater risk when it comes to health. Their bones are more fragile. There isn't enough room in their mouth for healthy teeth. They can have difficulty regulating their blood sugar and can go into hypoglycemic shock if they go too long without eating. Their internal organs are often weak and can fail suddenly – you might come downstairs one morning and find them inexplicably dead in their basket. Thus, responsible Chihuahua breeders never try to produce these high-risk creatures. If an especially tiny Chihuahua pops up in one of their normal-size litters, they find the best home they can for it. But they try not to produce them in the first place. So if possible, try to stick with Chihuahuas who will mature at 4 lbs and up. They have the best chance of living a normal healthy life. How can you tell whether a Chihuahua puppy will mature at 4 lbs and up? There's a general rule of thumb that says you can take the weight of a Chihuahua puppy at 14 weeks old and double it to estimate his adult weight. So to get an adult who will weigh 4 lbs and up, look for a 14-week-old pup who weighs at least 2 lbs. It's not perfect, but it's usually pretty close. Also look at the parents. If both parents are less than 6 lbs, their pups are more likely to be, too. If one or both is oversized, their pups are more likely to be, too. Would you feel silly bringing a postal scale along when you visit a litter of Chihuahua pups? I wouldn't. An awful lot of breeders will lowball their pups' weights in order to make a sale. Don't be too quick to pass up Chihuahuas who are at the top end of of normal, or even oversized individuals. They're still Chihuahuas, they're still plenty small, and they make sturdier pets.   We've already talked about different sizes. Chihuahuas also come in different coats (short and long), different head types (applehead and deerhead), and different body types (cobby build and deer build). Smooth Coat vs Long Coat Officially, Chihuahuas come in two varieties: Smooth Coat (shorthaired) and Long Coat (longhaired). Unofficially, Chihuahuas actually come in SIX coats, because the two varieties have three ""versions"" apiece: Smooth Coats are always short, but.... Smooth Coat Chihuahua and Long Coat Chihuahua Long Coats are always longer than Smooth Coats, but... Do Smooth Coats and Long Coats have different temperaments? Maybe. I find many (NOT ALL!) Long Coats to be milder-mannered and more willing to please. Most Chihuahuas I've seen competing in agility and obedience have been Long Coats. But I do love my quirky Smooth Coat rescue! Apple head Applehead vs deerhead Chihuahua clubs will tell you there is only one proper head type: a large rounded skull known as an apple head. The curvature begins at the back of the skull, arcs over the skull between the ears, and drops vertically down between the eyes to join the muzzle at about a 90-degree angle. Usually that muzzle is shortish, and rather broad and blunted. However, shortish can be carried to extremes. Some Chihuahua show lines have such short, blunt muzzles that they make snorting sounds. Not good. Deer head on a Chihuahua Although the Chihuahua clubs wish it weren't so.... there is another head type called a deer head (yes, like a deer). This Chihuahua head is flatter on top, rather than domed. Instead of having an abrupt vertical drop between the eyes, there is a gradual slope from the top of the head down between the eyes and continuing along a longer, pointier, foxier muzzle. This head is not correct for showing in the conformation ring. But it's fine for any other activity (obedience, agility, etc.).... and that slope is just right for kissing. Cobby build vs deer build Deer again? Yes, it's a bit confusing, but deer can describe a head shape (see above) or a body shape. Cobby build, apple head Some Chihuahuas are rather chunky and short-legged. This is known as a cobby build and you'll see a lot of them in show lines. It's fine in moderation, but if taken to extremes, it can result in squat Chihuahuas with curved legs and joint problems. This cute Chihuahua, all bundled for cold weather, has both a deer head and a deer build. Other Chihuahuas are more slender and longer-legged. This is known as a deer build and these dogs are often athletic and agile. But if taken to extremes, it can resemble a teeny tiny greyhound with long spindly legs. So in Chihuahuas, deer can refer to a slim, leggy build, or a flat-skulled, long-nosed head. Some Chihuahuas have both a deer-like build and a deer-like head. Others have one deer-like feature, but not the other.   Technically, Chihuahuas need very little outdoor exercise, so they're perfect dogs for owners who don't have a fenced yard. But truthfully.... Chihuahuas love to have a safe place to run and play on the grass, just like larger dogs do. And they adore half-mile walks around the block. Keep your Chihuahua on-leash! Even if you felt that your particular dog would stay with you, there are far too many dangers lurking for a dog of this size.   Attentive Chihuahuas with deer heads and deer builds Most Chihuahuas need very little obedience training. They need to learn only a few basic words, like No, Yes, Come, Wait, and Okay. Some individuals are easy to train, while others are a bit more stubborn. No is particularly important because you need to be able to stop your Chihuahua from barking and from acting suspiciously or aggressively toward strangers and other dogs. As important as those few words and commands are, housebreaking is even more important. Chihuahuas need to learn where to go to the bathroom, and where not to go – and this can be biggest training challenge in this breed. As a behavioral consultant, the Chihuahua is firmly on my Top 5 list of hardest breeds to housebreak. If you live in a cold or rainy climate, housebreaking will be especially difficult, because Chihuahuas hate both the cold and the rain. In these climates, a COVERED potty area is strongly recommended. Sometimes a doggy door is necessary so your Chihuahua can run outside the moment he feels the urge in his tiny bladder. An indoor litterbox is another option. All of these housebreaking options are detailed in my puppy training book, Respect Training For Puppies. Or see my advice on → dog training   Most Chihuahuas are naturally reserved with strangers. In fact, many Chihuahuas will put on a display of excited ferociousness (""they pitch a fit"") when other people approach what the Chihuahua considers to be ""his."" It sounds funny, but it's not. If you don't stop this behavior dead in its tracks, your Chihuahua may end up disliking everyone in the world, which is a short step to biting when someone unwittingly instrude on ""his"" space. Raising a Chihuahua properly means making it clear to him that yes, he can be aloof or suspicious – but without letting everyone within earshot know about it, and without progressing to threats. It's up to YOU to draw and enforce the line. Fortunately, there also exist Chihuahuas who are standoffish, but who will eventually approach people in their own good time, especially if the person isn't pushy or insistent. And some Chihuahuas are very friendly right from the get-go and will go to anyone.   I never recommend keeping a Chihuahua with children under the age of about 10, no matter how well-meaning the child. Younger children cannot help being clumsy, and that a child ""meant well"" is little solace to a Chihuahua who has been accidentally stepped on, sat on, squeezed, hit with an errant ball, or dropped down the stairs or onto the concrete patio. In addition, most Chihuahuas feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making, and stress and fearfulness (even defensive biting) may be the result.   Most Chihuahuas get along great with other pets in their own family. But you should be careful about mixing them with larger dogs. If you want to try this, be sure you can ""read"" canine body language accurately, and be sure the other dog is quiet, gentle, and well behaved. A big bouncy dog can hurt a Chihuahua by accident. I would not mix a Chihuahua with a breed whose heritage is chasing prey animals. Chihuahuas can look like prey animals, especially when they move quickly. This can trigger instinctive chasing behavior in breeds such as medium to large terriers, medium to large hounds, and northern (spitz) breeds like Alaskan Malamutes and Akitas. Chihuahuas love other Chihuahuas. If possible, you should keep a Chihuahua with another small breed, ideally another Chihuahua. This breed is unusual in that it usually recognizes and strongly prefers being with another member of its own breed. Two Chihuahuas will keep each other company when you're gone, will play together, will clean each other's ears (Chihuahuas can be obsessive ear-lickers!), and will keep each other warm by snuggling together. How do Chihuahuas get along with dogs outside their own family? Often not well. Chihuahuas often raise a ruckus when they spy a strange dog, especially a larger dog.
It's as though the Chihuahua wants to convince the larger dog that he is a force to reckon with rather than a helpless prey animal. The Chihuahua may be seeking to protect itself by putting up a blustering facade that tells the other dog to ""move along."" This is an anxious state of mind for your little dog to live with. Better to teach him that you are the leader who will take charge of keeping him safe and keeping other dogs away from him. Then he will be able to relax and leave everything up to you. That's the psychologically healthy and secure mind-set you want your dog to have. Summary: don't allow your Chihuahua to bellow threats at other dogs. It's not safe for the Chihuahua, it's not psychologically healthy for the Chihuahua, and it contributes to the breed's reputation as a nasty little yapper.   Gorgeous Long Coat Chihuahua with a saucy expression Chihuahuas are NOT a non-shedding breed. Chihuahuas are NOT hypo-allergenic. Chihuahuas are NOT on my list of Best Breeds For Allergy Sufferers. If you come to my house, you will leave with dark gray hairs on your clothes. Dark gray hairs that belong to my Chihuahua. Yes. Chihuahuas shed. Now, the actual amount of shedding depends on whether the coat is single or double. NOT on whether the coat is short or long, but whether it is double (outer coat plus undercoat) or single (just an outercoat). Remember we talked about single and double coats earlier. Whether a coat is short or long, the double coats shed more than the single coats. Which makes sense. Long Coat Chihuahuas need regular brushing and combing to prevent mats and tangles. The longer and thicker the coat, the more work it will be. Longhaired Chihuahuas also need trimming every few months. Focus on the longish hair around the dog's private parts. Otherwise whenever he goes to the bathroom, the result is going to be unsanitary, both for the dog and for your house. Anything that sticks to long hair eventually ends up on your floor or furnishings. So keep all of your dog's private parts trimmed short.   So beautiful! Nice moderate apple head with a graceful deer build Good news! Chihuahuas typically live 13-15 years. Some live even longer, though they're usually quite decrepit by then. Are they healthy for those 13-15 years? That depends on you. Chihuahuas are more prone to injury than to illness or disease. So whether a Chihuahua lives a long healthy life, or not, is more dependent on how careful you are to keep them safe. That's quite a responsibility! Here are some of the injuries Chihuahuas are vulnerable to: Remember, a tiny creature can be seriously injured or killed by something that a bigger dog would barely feel. Children should not pick up this breed. If an older child is trustworthy and your Chihuahua is calm and wearing a harness and leash, you can place her in the child's arms, but keep the leash short and under control. It's safer if children sit on the ground to hold and play with a Chihuahua. Owning a toy breed means constant supervision and surveillance of what's going on around your tiny dog. Outside of their own fenced yard, Chihuahuas should always be kept under leash or arm control. Too much can happen to these little guys in the blink of an eye. Chocolate, white, black and tan, and blue (it's actually gray, but it's called blue) Chihuahuas are most prone to: Here is my complete list of health problems in Chihuahuas. See my advice on → keeping your dog healthy
(feeding, vaccinations, neutering, veterinarians, and more).   According to the Chihuahua Standard, Chihuahuas can be any color – solid, marked, or splashed. Blue is not a normal color in dogs, like black or brown or white. There isn't a blue gene. Instead, a blue Chihuahua has inherited a normal black gene... plus a dilution gene that washes the black into a grayish shade that dog fanciers call blue. Dark blue Chihuahua. Blue ranges from light silver to dark charcoal.  I guess it kind of looks blue. Unfortunately, there is a skin problem associated with dilution genes. The symptoms are a gradual thinning or loss of the blue hair, plus nodules (bumps) on the skin, and repeated bacterial infections. If you have a blue Chihuahua or are thinking of getting one, read more about color dilution alopecia on my Chihuahua Health page. Merle is both striking and attractive: a swirled/patched/mottled pattern, usually gray-blue, black, tan, and white. Often one or both eyes is blue. You've probably seen this color in Australian Shepherds, Shelties, or Collies. Merle Long Coat Chihuahua Fairly recently, though, merle dogs have been showing up in a number of breeds (for example, Chihuahuas, Pomeranians, and Poodles) that historically didn't include merle dogs. The suspicion, probably justified, is that another breed with the merle gene was crossed with the breed that didn't have it, inserting the merle gene into the latter's gene pool. In the case of the Chihuahua, blue merle Dachshunds were probably crossed in. Which essentially means that merle Chihuahuas aren't truly purebred. But since genetic diversity is a good thing in living creatures, I don't view cross-breeding as an evil thing. If there are a few Dachshund genes floating around in a merle Chihuahua, that wouldn't bother me. But what does bother me are the potential health problems of merle Chihuahuas. Just as dilution genes act on pigment by washing it into a lighter color, merle genes act on pigment by whitening it. This results in lovely swirls and patches. Unfortunately, that whitening effect is not limited to hair. The pigment inside a dog's ears and on their eyes – essential pigment that nerve endings require to conduct auditory and visual impulses – can also whiten. The nerve endings gradually atrophy, resulting in partial or total hearing loss, and/or partial vision loss. This is most likely to happen when a puppy inherits merle genes from BOTH parents. Thus, a merle should never be bred to another merle, as the risk to the pups is huge. Skeletal and cardiac deformities can also occur. Because of these risks, many countries have banned merle Chihuahuas from being shown at dog shows. Some countries have even banned them from being registered. Here in the United States, the national Chihuahua Club and the American Kennel Club have chosen to accept merle Chihuahuas. So buyer beware. Don't buy a merle puppy from two merle parents. And don't let greedy breeders gouge you into paying an outrageous price for a color with potential health risks.   Classic apple head, short muzzle, tricolor Smooth Chihuahua Congratulations! I'll be happy to show you how to raise and train your new family member. I can help you with that, too. Chihuahuas are very common in the United States. Close to 200 breeds are ranked in popularity by the AKC (where 1 is most popular) and Chihuahuas rank around the 30th position. But they're actually much more common than that, because a lot of Chihuahuas are registered with other organizations, or left unregistered. What I'm saying is that it's very easy to find a Chihuahua. But first, are you really, really sure you want one? Are you sure you can provide what this breed needs? Next, consider whether you want a Smooth Coat or Long Coat, an applehead or deerhead, a cobby build or deer build. Chihuahuas love to be with other Chihuahuas Or you can just hop onto Craigslist and buy the first Chihuahua puppy you see from someone who ""just breeds pets"" or ""just had one litter."" But should you? Not unless the seller has done the proper health certifications on the puppy's parents. One huge difference between a responsible breeder and an irresponsible ""puppy producer"" is – health certifications. BOTH PARENTS of a Chihuahua puppy should have: A nice bonus would be if BOTH PARENTS of the puppy also have: If a seller can't show you those certificates, the puppies are higher risk for health problems. You might choose to accept that risk. But then you need to be willing (and able) to pay a couple thousand bucks for future surgeries and lifelong meds if your Chihuahua ends up with inherited cataracts and bad knee joints. See my advice on → finding  a good dog   Adopting an adult Chihuahua or Chihuahua mix can be very rewarding – for both you and the dog. Adopting From Dog Rescue Organizations
Chihuahuas (and Chihuahua crosses and mixes) are frequently available from Dog Rescue groups.
Chihuahuas may be turned over to Rescue because of housebreaking problems, or barking, or general nastiness when unsocialized or treated like babies. Other Chihuahuas are given up simply because of changed family circumstances, and these dogs may have no behavior problems at all. Adopting From Public Animal Shelters and Humane Societies
Chihuahuas can sometimes be found here, although shelter personnel can be overzealous in labeling every small dog with big eyes and ears as a ""Chihuahua cross."" Be aware that dogs can look like Chihuahuas without having any Chihuahua genes at all. Did you know there's a quick and simple DNA test that can tell you definitively which breeds make up any given dog?   The Papillon is similar to a Chihuahua in appearance.... at least similar to a longhaired, tricolored Chihuahua with a slender, graceful build. But the Papillon's temperament is quite different, tending to be milder-mannered, quicker-moving, more inclined to play fetch, and loves racing on an agility course. Also easier to housebreak! If you want a tiny breed and have allergies, consider the Yorkshire Terrier. Yorkies are a nice blend of terrier and toy traits and you clip the coat short for easy maintenance. But very hard to housebreak! If you want a truly spunky little guy with a low-maintenance coat, and you don't mind some shedding, consider the Toy Fox Terrier. He's similar to a Yorkie in being a blend of toy and terrier traits, but coming down a bit more on the terrier side. If your heart is set on a tiny dog and you're allergic, the light-shedding Maltese might fit the bill. Compared to Chihuahuas, Maltese have a softer, sweeter temperament, as their ancestry is not terrier, but spaniel. Hard to housebreak, though!"
Chinese Cresteds," The Chinese Crested is fine-boned, elegant, and graceful. And the Hairless variety is certainly unique-looking! High-spirited and happy, animated and agile, the Chinese Crested is an adept climber and jumper.... which sounds cool, except that some individuals are clever escape artists who can scale high fences or dig under them. This people-oriented ""Velcro"" dog depends emotionally on his owner for a lot of personal interaction. When you pick him up, he may grip your neck tightly with his paws (although he does the same thing with toys – he is quite adept at controlling his toes!) Because he is a needy dog, he doesn't like being left for long without companionship. Separation anxiety may set in, and then he is prone to ""acting out"" to relieve his anxiety. For example, destructive chewing. Reserved with strangers, some Crested lines and individuals are high-strung and/or timid with new people and new situations. Early and frequent socialization will help build a confident, stable temperament. Chinese Cresteds are usually playful with (though sometimes jealous of) other pets. Though independent and somewhat willful, the Chinese Crested is also bright and responds reasonably well to the discipline he needs to control his inquisitive activities. Unfortunately, housebreaking is very difficult. Unneutered males are especially challenging, as they are inclined to excessive marking of territory (i.e. lifting their leg in your house!) Some Chinese Cresteds are quite vocal and will bark (or howl) too much. If you want a dog who... A Chinese Crested may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Chinese Crested may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Chinese Crested If I was considering a Chinese Crested, I would be most concerned about... Chinese Crested puppies are not suited to young children, no matter how well-meaning the child. Children cannot help being clumsy, and that a child meant well is little solace to a Chinese Crested puppy who has been accidentally stepped on, sat on, rolled on, squeezed, or dropped onto the patio. Even Chinese Crested adults may feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making -- and stress and shyness (even defensive biting) may be the result."
Chinese Shar-peis," This sober and dignified dog with the wrinkled skin, ""hippopotamus"" head, and scowling expression stands firmly on the ground with a calm, confident stature. The Chinese Shar-pei is quiet and mannerly in the home, naturally clean and easy to housebreak. He makes an impressive companion if you're the kind of owner who can admire his independent character while still enforcing household rules so that he respects you. This can be a challenge, as this breed is dominant and obstinate – definitely not the choice for a first-time dog owner. Chinese Shar-Pei need only moderate exercise (several brisk daily walks), so they do quite well in the city or suburbs. In fact, unless they are securely fenced, they are not the best choice for a farm or rural setting, for they have strong hunting instincts and may run deer or molest livestock if they get loose. Aloof with strangers, Chinese Shar-Pei must be accustomed to people at an early age so that their natural territorial instincts are properly discriminatory. Though he usually minds his own business unless provoked, some Chinese Shar-Pei are aggressive with other dogs, and some individuals are predatory with cats. See below for warnings about health problems. Unfortunately, health is a major concern when considering this breed. If you want a dog who... A Chinese Shar-Pei may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Chinese Shar-Pei may not be right for you.

Frankly, most Chinese Shar Peis are ""too much dog"" for the average household. And if you have young children, I definitely don't recommend a Shar Pei. There are just too many individuals who won't tolerate any nonsense."
Chinook Dogs," Characterized by his dependable nature, sensible energy level, and sound working ability, the versatile Chinook is both frisky and dignified. He enjoys vigorous outdoor exercise such as backpacking, carting, agility, weight pulling, and especially recreational sledding and ski-joring. However, he is not a workaholic. If he is provided with reasonable physical and mental outlets for his enthusiasm, he is happy to settle on the sofa during quiet times. Very people-oriented, Chinooks require daily companionship (either by humans or other dogs) and can become bored and destructive if left alone too much. Gentleness and non-aggression are his hallmarks. Most will bark to announce visitors, but that's the extent of their guarding inclination. All sweet-natured, slightly reserved breeds have the potential for submissiveness and shyness, and this is true of the Chinook. Early socialization is required to build a confident temperament. Usually peaceful with other animals, he can be a chaser of rodents and trespassing cats. Chinooks are independent thinkers who may use their problem-solving skills to open gates and cupboards. They are also slow to mature, acting like big puppies for several years. If you want a dog who... A Chinook may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Chinook may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

Chow Chows," This dignified, serious dog with the lion-like ruff and scowling expression is a true introvert. Chow Chows must be accustomed to people at an early age so that their territorial instincts are properly discriminatory. The Chow is quiet and mannerly in the home, naturally clean and easy to housebreak. He makes an impressive companion if you're the kind of owner who can admire his independent character while still enforcing household rules so that he respects you. This can be a challenge, as this breed is dominant and obstinate – definitely not the choice for a first-time dog owner. With his bulky build and his unnatural stilted gait, he is not built to be a jogging or biking companion. Daily walks will do. However, there are two coat varieties, and the Smooth-coated Chow is often more active than his Rough-coated brother. Could just be because the less-heavy coat is easier to run around in! Though he usually minds his own business unless provoked, Chows can be aggressive with other dogs of the same sex. Some have strong hunting instincts and can be predatory with cats and tiny dogs. Obedience training this breed is not easy. Chows cannot be forced to do anything – they will either ""shut down"" or retaliate if you jerk them around with a choke collar. Better to use a dog training method that earns your Chow's respect and emphasizes praise and occasional food rewards. If you want a dog who... A Chow Chow may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Chow Chow may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Chow Chow If I was considering a Chow, I would be most concerned about... Chow Chows have a complex temperament and an independent mind of their own. Most individuals are willful and dominant (they want to be the boss) and will make you prove that you can make them do things. You must show them, through absolute consistency, that you mean what you say. Read more on Chow Chow Training. This is not a breed for a first-time dog owner nor for a home with young children. The problem is that many Chows distrust strangers and many Chows are resistant to being told what to do. Put those together and you can see that Chows might not like being hoisted onto a grooming table and told to stand still by someone they don't know. You need to do a great deal of socialization with this breed. Lots of exposure to friendly people. Lots of firmness on your part that your Chow Chow must act politely at all times. He doesn't have to like it, but he has to do it. Socialization is a great responsibility for Chow owners."
Clumber Spaniels," The mild-mannered, almost imperturbable Clumber Spaniel sometimes puts on aristocratic airs. Yet he also plays the clown, greeting people with two tennis balls stuffed into his mouth and his entire rear end wagging. Adult Clumbers spend much of their time lying around and looking sleepy, but this massive dog needs regular exercise to stay fit. Outdoors he comes alive and moves with great determination – he has been called ""a great bustling creature."" Fetching and ball playing are good sources of exercise, but don't allow too much twisting or jumping, else he injure a disk in his unnaturally long back. Most Clumber Spaniels are friendly with strangers and other animals. This is not a guard dog. Though stubborn, he does respond to persuasive, persistent, motivational obedience training, especially if it includes food. He resists harshness or force by refusing to move. The Clumber Spaniel does have a mischievous streak, especially when young. But because of his easygoing approach to life, he is seldom a problem even when he doesn't obey very quickly. If you want a dog who... A Clumber Spaniel may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Clumber Spaniel may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Clumber Spaniel If I was considering a Clumber Spaniel, I would be most concerned about... Clumber Spaniels need daily outings in a good-sized enclosed area (yard or dog park) so they can romp about. Otherwise they will become bored, which dogs tend to express by becoming destructive. Clumber Spaniels are big-time chewers when bored!"
English Cocker Spaniels," The AKC Standard says, ""His enthusiasm in the field and the incessant action of his tail while at work indicate how much he enjoys the hunting for which he was bred."" With more sporting instincts than the American Cocker Spaniel, the lively English Cocker Spaniel likes more exercise. When well socialized, the English Cocker Spaniel has a merry tail-wagging nature and is sweet and gentle with everyone. Some are on the reserved side, and there is timidity and excessive submissiveness in some lines. This equable dog is responsive to persuasive obedience training that includes praise and food rewards. Unless taught to be independent, some individuals are so persistently affectionate that they become clingy and demanding of attention. If you want a dog who...

Rough & Smooth Collies," In this review, I'm not talking about the more common Border Collie, but rather the Scottish or Scotch Collie that comes in a long coat (called Rough) and a short coat (called Smooth). The Rough Collie is the more common of the two – picture ""Lassie."" Most of today's Rough and Smooth Collies are far removed from their heritage as active herding breeds and need only moderate exercise. In my experience, the Smooth variety is a little closer to his roots, so tends to want more exercise and mental stimulation than the Rough variety. What Collies need most is a great deal of personal attention. Collies become unhappy if left for long periods of time without the companionship of people or other pets. Unhappiness can result in chronic barking or destructive chewing. Rough and Smooth Collies have a soft, sweet personality. They are sensitive dogs who do not do well in an environment with frequent tension or loud voices. Collies are peaceful with other pets and polite with strangers. As with most sweet-natured breeds, there is potential for timidity, so young Collies need to be thoroughly socialized in order to build a confident temperament. Collies have a mild-to-moderate stubborn streak, but they're reasonably easy to train if you maintain a calm voice and a light hand on the leash. Usually they need only verbal corrections, gentle leash guidance, and lots of praise and encouragement. Some individuals, unfortunately, can be hypersensitive and highstrung. These dogs are more difficult to work with. The most common behavioral issue is excessive barking, typically when bored and left outside, or when left alone too much. All Collies are individuals, but in general, Smooth Collies tend to be more athletic and agile and retain more working instincts. Rough Collies, in general, are a bit calmer. If you want a dog who... A Rough or Smooth Collie may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Rough or Smooth Collie may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Rough or Smooth Collie If I was considering a Collie, I would be most concerned about... Obviously, Smooth Collies don't need combing or trimming, but they still need frequent brushing when the dog is shedding (because hairs that end up in the brush do not end up on your clothes and furniture!)"
Coonhounds," There are a number of coonhound breeds, the most popular being the Black and Tan Coonhound (pictured), Bluetick Coonhound, Redbone Coonhound, Plott Hound, Treeing Walker Coonhound, English Coonhound, and American Leopard Hound. These dogs are first and fundamentally working dogs – they hunt large and small game. Though good-natured and easygoing, these hardy hounds are so in need of hard physical exercise that they belong with an owner who will take them hunting, jogging (on dirt or grass, not concrete), hiking, and/or swimming. The problem with providing exercise is that, unless well-trained for hunting, it is a major risk to allow coonhounds off-leash. They are inveterate explorers who will follow their nose over hill, over dale, through the woods – and onto the highway. An enclosed dog park is probably your safest option. When well-exercised, coonhounds are calm and undemanding dogs, apt to sprawl and snore in front of the fire. Without exercise, on the other hand, a coonhound can be a rambunctious handful. Coonhounds get along very well with other dogs, though some can be dominant and pushy as they test each other for favorable positions in the pecking order. Befitting their predator ancestry, coonhounds may stalk smaller pets, though they may get along fine with the family cat (as long as he doesn't run!). It is in a coonhound's nature to constantly figure out ways to outwit his prey, so he often does the same with people. In other words, following commands blindly is not part of a coonhound's genetic makeup. Put yet another way.... coonhounds can be very stubborn! Consistent leadership is a must, and obedience training must be upbeat and persuasive (include occasional food rewards). If you want a dog who... A Coonhound may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Coonhound may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Coonhound If I was considering a Coonhound, I would be most concerned about... Coonhounds were never intended to be simply household pets. Their working behaviors (following scents, chasing things that run, exploring, baying) can be a nuisance in a normal household setting. Trying to suppress these ""hardwired"" behaviors, without providing alternate outlets for their energy, can be difficult and is not fair to the dog."
Coton de Tulear," Happy, clownish, and inquisitive, the Coton de Tulear enjoys clever games of dexterity such as ""pull the stale bit of fallen cheese from under the refrigerator with your paw."" He is both boisterous and calm – dashing around the yard to play, then snuggling in your lap to snooze. Cotons are very people-oriented and will push for as much attention as they can get. They are so sociable that they don't do well when left for long periods without companionship. ""Not doing well"" means unhappiness and boredom, which they try to vent through barking and destructive chewing. Though peaceful and gentle with everyone (humans and other pets), this breed forms a strong bond with his family and can be conservative with strangers. Socialization is important to build a confident, outgoing temperament, as there is a potential for excessive caution/timidity. Though he does have a mild stubborn streak, the Coton de Tulear is normally a ""soft"" dog and responds well to non-forceful training. He prefers learning tricks to formal obedience and is especially bright-eyed when occasional food treats are offered as rewards. Harshness only makes him wilt. The most problematic training issue is housebreaking – Cotons tend to be slow to housetrain. Barking needs to be curtailed, as well. If you want a dog who... A Coton de Tulear may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Coton de Tulear may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Coton de Tulear If I was considering a Coton de Tulear, I would be most concerned about... For ease of care, consider clipping your Coton's coat short so that brushing and combing is minimized. Then he will look like an adorable puppy throughout his life. If the potential housebreaking problem sounds like a deal-breaker to you, don't give up! Consider adopting an already-housebroken adult Coton de Tulear from a rescue group. Other concerns in the breed are urinary problems and bladder stones, along with loose knee joints that may require surgery. Read more about Coton de Tulear Health."
Curly-Coated Retrievers," This strong and robust dog is also elegant and graceful, quick and agile. His daily exercise requirement is such that he belongs with an athletic owner who will take him jogging, biking, hiking, and swimming. Though reserved and sometimes distrustful with strangers, he should remain poised and hold his ground. A Curly Coated Retriever puppy needs more socialization than other retrievers to develop a confident temperament. Many have sensible protective instincts and may not welcome strangers into their homes as will a Golden or Labrador Retriever. He relates well to other animals and is playful and accepting. Described as ""wickedly smart,"" he may use his intelligence in clever, independent ways that suit his own purposes. Thus he needs early obedience training to establish that you are in charge. All retrievers are slow to mature, and the Curly-Coat remains playfully puppyish for many years. This sounds delightful, but does require patience and control to live with. If you want a dog who...

Dachshunds," Dachshunds come in an impressive variety of sizes, coats, and colors. There are Standard Dachshunds (the largest) and Miniature Dachshunds and even ""Tweener"" Dachshunds (a non-official term for individuals who fit between Standards and Minis. There are Shorthaired (Smooth), Longhaired, and Wirehaired Dachshunds. The most common colors are reddish brown, or black with a few tan markings, but many colors and patterns are possible. Curious, lively, charming, and brave, the Dachshund is similar to a terrier in his demands to be in on everything. This comical clown loves to play games and has a great sense of humor. He is a loyal little dog, very attached to his family, and he firmly believes that sleeping under the bedcovers is in the Dachshund Bill of Rights. Dachshunds attract devoted followers who would never consider having any other breed. Indeed, Dachshunds are often kept in pairs, which is A-OK with them, since they seem to recognize and prefer being with other ""wiener dogs"". They're usually good with other family pets, too, though they can be jealous when they want attention and they can be possessive of their toys. You need to put a firm stop to the first signs of jealousy or possessiveness so that these don't become bad habits. Though the Dachshund makes a great house dog, he does need his daily walks (on-leash! Dachshunds are chasers who will take off! -- and plenty of companionship. Loneliness will lead to excessive barking. You'll also hear his sharp, persistent bark when people approach, for most Dachshunds are alert watchdogs who do not take kindly to strangers intruding on their domain. Again, you need to put a stop to overt signs of suspiciousness, lest this progress to nastiness. Though bright and clever, Dachshunds like to do things their own way. In other words, they're stubborn. Cheerful praise and treats should be offered freely, as Dachsies are proud little dogs who resist force. They become irritable when pushed too far, and they may respond defensively (growling or snapping) if jerked around, handled harshly, or teased. Other behavioral problems? Well, the Dachshund's hunting and tunneling instincts may lead to holes being dug in your garden. Also, housebreaking may go slowly, as many Dachshunds don't like to go outside in cold or wet weather. A covered potty yard is recommended, if possible. In general, Miniature Dachshunds are more active than the larger Standard Dachshunds. Comparing the three coat varieties: But remember, these are just generalities! If you want a dog who...

Dachshunds can also suffer from epilepsy, urinary diseases, heart disease, itchy skin conditions, and more. Read more about Dachshund Health."
Dalmatians," A good Dalmatian is a dependable, dignified gentleman, yet high-spirited and playful. A good Dalmatian, I said. Unfortunately there are a good number of poorly-bred Dalmatians around, mostly produced when unknowledgable pet owners watch the 101 Dalmatians movie and think it might be fun to make spotted puppies and sell them for big bucks. These poorly-bred pups often end up with serious temperament flaws. In addition, even a good Dalmatian needs plenty of exercise and companionship. Too much confinement (especially without the companionship of his family) and too little mental stimulation lead to boredom, hyperactivity, and destructive behaviors. This athletic, vigorous dog has great endurance and a working heritage and should be taken jogging, hiking, or biking on a regular basis, or otherwise allowed to romp in a safe, enclosed area. Challenging canine activities such as advanced obedience and agility (obstacle course) are also highly recommended. Some Dalmatians greet strangers with enthusiastic jumping, while others are politely reserved. Some have mild protective instincts. Unfortunately, skittishness and/or aggression are seen in some lines, and plenty of socialization is required to promote a stable temperament. Usually good with other family pets, the Dalmatian is especially fond of horses. This breed is an independent thinker, but in the right hands is capable of learning and doing anything. Owners who don't understand the necessity of leadership or training will find him an impossible handful. If you want a dog who... A Dalmatian may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with...

Dandie Dinmont Terriers," The plucky Dandie Dinmont is one of the brightest of the terriers – but also one of the most independent. Undemanding, dignified, and relaxed in the home, the Dandie becomes bold and tenacious when his hunting/chasing instincts are aroused. One look at his long, low-slung body and it's obvious that this breed isn't built for long-distance jogging or running beside your bike. He is content with daily walks and regular opportunities to play. Though diplomatic with strangers, the Dandie Dinmont Terrier is confident of his territory and makes a determined watchdog. He doesn't put on a macho posturing act with other animals, as some terriers do, but he is exceedingly tough and will not back down from a confrontation. Two adult males are definitely an unwise combination. Assertive and strong-willed, with a definite mind of his own, he requires consistent leadership. Obedience training should include food rewards and praise, for the Dandie is sensitive and proud. Heavy-handed training only makes him more obstinate and uncooperative. If you want a dog who... A Dandie Dinmont Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Dandie Dinmont Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Dandie Dinmont Terrier If I was considering a Dandie Dinmont Terrier, I would be most concerned about... I do not recommend terriers for homes with small children. Many terriers will not tolerate any nonsense from little life forms whom they consider to be below themselves in importance. Many terriers are quick to react to teasing, and even to the normal clumsiness that comes with small children (accidental squeezing of their ears or pulling of whiskers or stepping on their paw). Many terriers are possessive of their food and toys and will defend these from all comers, including children."
Doberman Pinschers," Called Doberman Pinscher in some countries and just plain Dobermann (with two n's) in others, this athletic dog needs brisk walking every day and all-out running as often as possible. Too little exercise and too little companionship can lead to restlessness and other behavioral problems. Mental exercise (advanced obedience, agility, tracking, Schutzhund) is just as important to this thinking breed. Though some Doberman Pinschers are big softies who love everyone, most are reserved with strangers and protective of their family. Early and extensive socialization is mandatory to avoid either shyness or sharpness. Some Doberman Pinschers are dominant with other dogs. Some are confirmed cat chasers, while others love small animals. Some excel in advanced obedience competition, while others are hardheaded and will test to find their place in the pecking order. Calm, consistent leadership is a must, and obedience training must be upbeat and persuasive rather than sharp. This breed does not tolerate teasing or mischief. If you want a dog who... A Doberman Pinscher may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Doberman Pinscher may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Doberman Pinscher If I was considering a Doberman Pinscher, I would be most concerned about... I always feel sorry when I meet a smart-as-a-whip Doberman Pinscher whose life consists of walks around the block and being let out into the yard. This is a waste of such a capable breed. To really provide the best life for a Doberman Pinscher, I recommend getting him involved in a canine activity where he can use his athletic skills and intelligent mind. Agility classes, for example. Or advanced obedience classes (not a basic beginners class, but ongoing classes). Or join a tracking or schutzhund club. The Doberman Pinscher was never intended to be just a casual pet. A good Doberman is fine with their family's children. But some Dobermans may try to protect their own children from other children, even if the kids are simply roughhousing. More concerning is the number of Dobermans who are so sensitive that they become nervous and hyper-reactive with the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making. So if you have children, you need to be extremely careful when evaluating Doberman Pinscher lines. Frankly, most Doberman Pinschers are ""too much dog"" for the average household. The breed is best suited in a calm household with experienced owners who are interested in participating in some sort of canine activity."
Dogue de Bordeaux," The Dogue de Bordeaux or French Mastiff  is quiet, calm, and relaxed – until aroused. Don't be lulled by his bulk. He can be surprisingly athletic and agile when necessary. This is not an apartment dog. To stay fit, he needs some space and moderate daily exercise. But more than anything else, he requires personal interaction. Picture that massive body trying to settle itself onto your lap and an enormous tongue swiping across your face. Dogues love to be an integral part of your family. Dogue de Bordeaux puppies should be friendly and trusting, and with proper socialization, become reserved and discriminating as they mature. As with all mastiffs, socialization is an absolute requirement to avoid either aggression or shyness. Animal aggression can be a problem; most Dogues will not start fights, but they will surely finish them. This stubborn breed is inclined to do things his own way, but he will respond to early, consistent training that includes firm leadership, cheerful praise, and food rewards. The Dogue de Bordeaux has an astonishing talent for snoring, sliming, and drooling. Slobber towels  should be high on your list of canine accessories. If you want a dog who... A Dogue de Bordeaux may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Dogue de Bordeaux may not be right for you.

English Pointers," In the United States, this breed is simply called Pointer, while in other parts of the world, the name English Pointer is used to distinguish him from similar pointing breeds. For example, the German Shorthaired Pointer, Italian Pointer, Portuguese Pointer, French Pointers, etc. Since my website has an international audience, we'll use that clear name, English Pointer. The AKC Standard says, ""Every movement shows him to be a wide-awake, hard-driving hunting dog possessing stamina, courage, and desire to go."" Though dignified and sweet-natured, the English Pointer is bred primarily for hunting. He is packed with energy and belongs with an active owner who will give him the running exercise he needs to feel satisfied. English Pointers, especially youngsters, become restless and bored when confined too much and may resort to destructive chewing and barking. A long walk is barely a warm-up for this superb athlete. With strangers, most English Pointers are slightly reserved, but congenial. This is not a guard dog. He is also amiable with other animals. A bit stubborn and easily distracted, but also very sensitive, the English Pointer responds well to patient obedience training that includes food rewards and praise rather than jerking around. Commands such as ""down"" and ""stay"" are important for instilling self-discipline and control. If you want a dog who... An English Pointer may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An English Pointer may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the English Pointer If I was considering an English Pointer, I would be most concerned about... If you simply want a pet for your family, and don't have the time or inclination to take your dog running or hiking or biking, or to get involved in hunting, I do not recommend this breed (unless you adopt an older adult with a mellow temperament)."
English Setters," There are two distinct types of English Setter. The original field/hunting type (sometimes called the ""Llewellin Setter"") is smaller, with a broader, natural-looking head and much less hair. These dogs have strong hunting instincts and need vigorous exercise. The ""bench"" or ""show"" type of English Setter is quite tall, with a long narrow head and a profusion of silky hair that needs plenty of brushing and trimming. These dogs are more laid-back than field lines and are content with long daily walks and occasional running and fetching games. Whatever their type, English Setters tend to be the mildest-mannered of the three setter breeds (English, Irish, and Gordon). They are very sociable dogs who must not be left alone all day without the company of people or other pets, else destructiveness may result. English Setters have an obstinate streak that takes the form of resistance rather than wild disobedience. If pushed too hard, they'll simply brace their legs and refuse to walk. You must be persistent, but never heavy-handed. English Setters have long memories, which means that once they learn something (whether right or wrong), they remember it. On the negative side, this means bad habits can be difficult to break. If you want a dog who... An English Setter may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with...

English Shepherds," The English Shepherd is noted for his calm dependability and is content to curl up at your feet at the end of the day. However, that day must include a good amount of physical exercise and mental stimulation. This is an active, athletic dog. Herding, advanced obedience, agility, jogging or biking, chasing balls, and playing Frisbee are productive outlets for his enthusiasm. Most English Shepherds are polite with strangers and make sensible watchdogs, but extensive socialization is required when young to avoid shyness. Most are fine with other pets if raised with them, but they can be dominant with strange animals. This is an attentive, sensitive breed who likes to keep his eye on you. Highly trainable, the English Shepherd is an all-purpose working and competition dog who learns quickly. Yet he does have the typical independence of a herding breed. In other words, this is not a ""push-button"" breed. You must have the confidence to establish and enforce rules, or he will make up his own. English Shepherds prefer their charges (family members and other pets) to be gathered together and may try to accomplish this by circling, poking, and nipping. If you want a dog who... An English Shepherd may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An English Shepherd may not be right for you.

English Springer Spaniels," This high-spirited tail-wagger needs at least one long vigorous run every day. Without exercise an English Springer Spaniel can be a boisterous handful, especially when young. His opinion of strangers varies from friendly to reserved. Most are good watchdogs, but not guardians. Caution: There is serious dominance/aggression lurking in the background of some lines. Early socialization and stable parents are essential in this breed. Most English Springers are gregarious with other animals, though there is some same-sex aggression. Some individuals can be so persistently affectionate that they become clingy, which can result in separation anxiety and destructiveness when left alone. Many Springers love getting into puddles and water bowls and tracking mud through the house. This is not a dainty breed, nor one for fastidious housekeepers. If you want a dog who...

English Toy Spaniels," One of the most amiable and undemanding of the toys, the elegant English Toy Spaniel is easy to live with and easy to like. One breeder describes him as ""quiet, intimate, dignified, funny, and sweet."" Though he does love to play in the yard, he doesn't need or want much more exercise than that. The yard must be fenced, for he has just enough spaniel instincts to chase birds or butterflies into the street. Calm indoors, a lover of comfort and couches, he enjoys cuddling on laps and snuggling into soft pillows. His soulful eyes invite pampering, which he accepts graciously without taking nasty advantage. This docile yet merry breed is terrific for senior citizens. At the other end of the spectrum, he is easily overwhelmed by small children and cannot take rough handling or mischief. The ""Charlie"" (reflecting his European name: King Charles Spaniel) is somewhat reserved with strangers. His own family is enough for him, thank you very much. He is mildly stubborn, but the little training he needs will go well if you use praise and encouragement -- and food rewards never hurt. If you want a dog who...

Entlebucher Mountain Dogs," Steady and good-natured, yet bold and athletic, the stocky, muscular Entlebucher Mountain Dog (also known as the Entlebucher Sennenhund) enjoys romping and roughhousing. Pulling a cart or sled, herding, agility, fetching balls, playing Frisbee, and weight pulling are productive outlets for his high energy. He likes to keep busy and needs something to do. He is not an apartment dog. Entlebuchers bond closely with their family and seek lots of attention. Their determination to jump up into your face or shove their body against your leg can be disconcerting to those not accustomed to an enthusiastic, vigorous dog. They like children, but will bowl over little ones. The Entlebucher Mountain Dog makes a vigilant watchdog. He will sound off in a loud, deep voice to announce visitors -- or simply to let you know that your neighbor has stepped outdoors. His attitude toward strangers varies from exuberantly friendly to polite to suspicious. Early and ongoing socialization is essential to develop the stable, self-assured temperament that all of the Swiss mountain dogs are known for. The Entlebucher learns quickly but can be dominant and pushy -- necessary traits for working with unruly cattle, but challenging for nonassertive owners to handle. During adolescence, his hormones will kick in and he may start to test limits. Obedience training should start early. Heeling is an especially imperative lesson, for these powerful dogs can literally pull you off your feet. Entlebuchers bark sharply while working, so be prepared to control excessive vocalization from the beginning. If you want a dog who... An Entlebucher Mountain Dog may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Entlebucher Mountain Dog may not be right for you.

More traits and characteristics of the Entlebucher Mountain Dog If I was considering an Entlebucher Mountain Dog, I would be most concerned about... I do not recommend this breed if you don't have the time or inclination to take your dog hiking or swimming or to the dog park, or to get involved in herding, or weight-pulling, or carting, or tracking, or agility (obstacle course), or advanced obedience, or a similar canine activity. Entlebucher Mountain Dogs were never intended to be simply household pets. To teach your Entlebucher to listen to you, ""Respect Training"" is mandatory.

Field Spaniels," Although level-headed and mild-mannered, the Field Spaniel has more sporting instincts than most other spaniels and appreciates as much running, biking, hiking, or field work as you can provide. It isn't fair to keep this lively little hunter, bred for activity and endurance, in a small yard with only a walk around the block for exercise. When socialized early and extensively, the Field Spaniel is accepting of strangers, though he seldom runs right up to people as might a Cocker or Springer. Field Spaniels do have an independent streak but respond well to light-handed, upbeat training. This sensitive breed cringes or withdraws when treated roughly or jerked around. Some of these spaniels enjoy hearing the sound of their own voices, i.e. they can be barky. The fun-loving Field Spaniel also enjoys splashing in puddles and slobbering in water bowls and will track mud around the house with his oversized webbed feet. Not a good breed for the fastidious housekeeper! If you want a dog who... A Field Spaniel may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Field Spaniel may not be right for you.

Fila Brasileiro," The Fila Brasileiro (FEE-la brahzi LAIR o), also known as the Brazilian Mastiff, was developed to be a hunting dog, and a ranch and plantation dog. The Fila would guard the estate, hunt big game animals such as jaguars, and work with livestock, driving it around the farm and ""catching"" individual cattle (grabbing hold of its neck) for the Brazilian rancher. The Fila would also track runaway slaves for the plantation owner. You can see the Bloodhound ancestry in the Fila's loose skin and superb tracking skills. The Fila has an unusual way of moving. With his hindquarters raised slightly above his forequarters, the Fila moves like a great feline, with a long, low, stalking stride. He tends to amble or pace and there is a rolling motion to his gait. So far, so good. The Fila Brasileiro sounds like a great all-around working dog. But then we get to the Fila's temperament. ""Faithful as a Fila dog"" is an old Brazilian proverb. With good reason, because the Fila has a temperament unlike that of any other breed. Docile with his own family and immensely loyal, the Fila has an extreme aversion to strangers and detests being touched by outsiders. The Portuguese have a word for their temperament: Ojeriza, roughly meaning dislike and distrust. Fila puppies should be friendly and trusting, and with proper socialization become more discriminating as they mature. Their eventual degree of aversion to strangers depends on genetics (parents and grandparents) and environment (socialization and training). Some lines are milder, while some lines are extremely sharp, i.e. extremely aggressive toward all outsiders. One might take the Fila's massive bulk for laziness or clumsiness – and one would be terribly mistaken. Like all Old World mastiffs, the Fila Brasileiro is calm and quiet, until aroused. Then he shifts into his fierce protector's role in an instant, moving with tremendous speed and athletic agility. People who keep this dog need to be fully aware of their responsibilities in protecting the innocent public. That includes your own friends and relatives if they don't visit often enough for the dog to accept them as part of the family. Yes, a Fila will attack your Uncle Bill for scooping up little Johnny to give him a hug. Do you have casual visitors or acquintances dropping by? Do you take frequent trips and think that a neighbor or pet sitter can drop by and care for your Fila the same way one might care for a Labrador Retriever, or even a German Shepherd? Do you think you can take your adult Fila to the local park where people will wander past and pet him? How easy do you think visits to the vet are going to be? Most people interested in this breed have not thought it through. They see a YouTube video or visit a Fila site where the aggressive ""virtues"" of the breed are proclaimed to the heavens, where the breeder boasts about the ""toughness"" of their dogs. Your Uncle Bill is seldom mentioned on these sites. So we've seen how the Fila behaves with people. Let's look now at the breed's behavior with other animals. Although the Fila was not used for dogfighting (indeed, they often hunted in packs and got along fine), dog-to-dog aggression is a problem in modern lines. The Fila Brasileiro ""may"" live peacefully with other pets in his own family, but he may not, too. I wouldn't keep a Fila Brasileiro with another dog of the same sex. Honestly, I wouldn't keep one with another dog at all, especially a smaller dog. No cats, either. Remember, this was a hunting breed, which means a strong prey drive (instincts to chase and grab things that run). Is the Fila Brasileiro hard to train? It depends on how good you are at establishing the proper Leader-Follower relationship with a huge, powerful dog who cannot be out-muscled. This strong-willed breed does want to please his owner IF you are a confident leader who understands how to read and respond properly to canine body language and how to elevate yourself above your dog in the pecking order. Consistent rules and cheerful praise are mandatory. Let's talk about a few more practical realities of owning a Fila Brasileiro: The Fila Brasileiro is far too much for the vast majority of households, and I mean 99% of households. This breed was more suited to the past than to our modern society."
Finnish Spitz," The fox-like Finnish Spitz is lively and agile, quick and light on his feet. He plays hard and enjoys vigorous exercise, especially in the snow. Without enough activity (physical and mental), this creative thinker will become bored and perhaps destructive. He is very people-oriented and needs a great deal of companionship, especially from his favorite person. He doesn't like being left alone,and because of his extremely sensitive nature, he doesn't do well in an environment with frequent tension or loud voices. The Finnish Spitz is sharp-eyed and keen of hearing and will immediately alert when he sees or hears anything unusual. Conservative with strangers, he requires early and frequent socialization to ensure that his caution does not become suspicion or shyness. He also needs early physical handling as he often does not like being examined. Typically bold with other dogs, he can be jealous and scrappy with those of the same sex and predatory with rodents and birds. The Finnish Spitz learns quickly but is clever and independent and thus challenging to train. These vocal dogs will greet you with throaty sounds of crooning, purring, and yodeling. They love to bark, and their barking pattern is high-pitched, piercing, and rapid (more than 150 barks per minute). If left outside unattended, they can drive neighbors up the wall. If you want a dog who... A Finnish Spitz may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Finnish Spitz may not be right for you.

Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Finnish Spitz If I was considering a Finnish Spitz, I would be most concerned about... Unless exceedingly well-trained, Finnish Spitz should be trusted off-leash. Remember that they are hunting dogs – they will take off after anything that runs."
Flat-Coated Retrievers," The AKC Standard says, ""The Flat-Coated Retriever demonstrates stability and a desire to please with a confident, happy, and outgoing attitude characterized by a wagging tail."" This cheerful dog is athletic, not a couch potato, so he needs plenty of exercise -- ideally exercise that includes swimming and fetching. Otherwise he will find outlets for his energy through destructive chewing and digging. The gregarious Flatcoated Retriever thrives on personal attention and doesn't like being left for long periods of time without the companionship of people or other pets. Optimistic about everyone and everything, this good-natured breed is emphatically not a guardian. He is eternally lighthearted and playful, doesn't know his own strength, and can be an exuberant jumper. Supervision is important around toddlers and smaller pets. You must control his tendency to chew on objects and to mouth your hands -- provide a box filled with toys so he can carry something around in his mouth. A Flat Coated Retriever retains his youthfully good-humored outlook on life into old age, which sounds delightful but which does require patience and control to manage. Obedience training is a must to instill calmness and good manners. Fortunately, he is responsive and biddable, though not as ""push-button"" as a Golden Retriever. He has a willful streak. If you want a dog who... A Flat-Coated Retriever may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Flat-Coated Retriever may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

More traits and characteristics of the Flat-Coated Retriever If I was considering a Flat-Coated Retriever, I would be most concerned about... Sadly, this lovely breed suffers from malignant tumors of all kinds – most notably deadly histiocytic sarcoma, which occurs in Flat-Coats and Bernese Mountain Dogs FAR more than in any other breed. Also lymphosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, osteosarcoma, mastocytoma, melanoma, fibrosarcoma, adenocarcinoma, and others."
Wire & Smooth Fox Terriers," The Fox Terrier (whether smooth or wirehaired) is one of the most curious, intense, and impulsive of the terriers. Untiringly active and playful, he has a special passion for ball chasing, which really helps with exercise! The Fox Terrier loves the outdoors but must always be kept on-leash (he is a fast, agile, independent chaser) or in a secure yard, supervised, because his ingenuity and relentless hunting instincts may drive him over or under the fence. This daredevil does best with active owners who are firm, confident, consistent leaders. He has a marked stubborn streak, a mischievous sense of humor, and will take clever advantage if indulged. Fox Terriers have a peppery personality and are scrappy and fearless with other animals. They won't back down if challenged, and they may do much of the challenging themselves. They have a high prey drive and extremely quick reflexes, so little creatures that run won't get far. This breed has keen vision and acute hearing and can be counted on to sound the alert when anything is amiss & sometimes even when nothing is amiss, but might be in the future! Fox Terriers love to tunnel and dig and can be possessive of their food and cherished toys. If you want a dog who... A Smooth or Wirehaired Fox Terrier may be right for you.

Terriers cannot be trusted off-leash. They will take off -- oblivious to your frantic shouts -- after anything that runs. I do not recommend terriers for homes with small children. Many terriers will not tolerate any nonsense from little life forms whom they consider to be below themselves in importance. Many terriers are quick to react to teasing, and even to the normal clumsiness that comes with small children (accidental squeezing of their ears or pulling of whiskers or stepping on their paw). Many terriers are possessive of their food and toys and will defend these from all comers, including children. Obviously, Smooth Fox Terriers don't need trimming, but you should brush them frequently when they're shedding, because hairs that end up in the brush don't end up on your clothes and furniture!"
French Bulldogs," Despite his glum expression, the French Bulldog is comical, entertaining, and dependably amiable. As comfortable in an apartment as he is on a farm, he is more lively than you might suspect from his chunky appearance. French Bulldog puppies are especially frisky, and ball chasing is one of their passions. Adults are more dignified and can be champion couch potatoes, but also love to clown around and go for walks in cool weather. Many Frenchies are friendly with everyone, while others are politely reserved. French Bulldogs will bark to announce visitors, but are otherwise quiet dogs. Usually peaceful with other pets (though some French Bulldogs will hunt small rodents), males may bicker with other males. The French Bulldog is quite stubborn and can be challenging to train, yet also surprisingly sensitive, remembers what he learns, and responds well to early, patient, persistent training that utilizes food motivation. Snorting, snuffling, and flatulence (gassiness) go with the territory of short-faced breeds. Swimming pool owners must exercise caution: Because of his squat build and heavy head, most Frenchies cannot swim and will drown if they fall into a pool. If you want a dog who...

German Pinschers," The German Pinscher Club of America calls this breed ""energetic, watchful, agile, fearless, determined."" I would add ""strong-willed, assertive, and manipulative."" Both robust and elegant, the German Pinscher comes from a strong terrier background. This high-energy breed always seems to be observing, thinking, and planning. He makes direct eye contact and unless you establish yourself as the leader, he can be demanding and frequently in your face. This is not a good breed for first-time owners or for any owner who tends to be passive or permissive. Yet the German Pinscher is extremely smart and clever, and owners who know how to lead will find him eminently trainable. Very loyal, highly territorial, and keenly alert, the German Pinscher takes his watchdog role very seriously. He won't hesitate to back up his fierce bark with a bite. Early and frequent socialization is required so that his wariness does not become sharpness. This is a serious responsibility that dog owners assume when they choose a German Pinscher. Most German Pinschers are okay (though bossy) with other dogs IF raised with them. But this breed has a high prey drive and quick reflexes and is death on anything that runs. The German Pinscher can be overly possessive of objects (yours and his), and excessive barking can be a problem. If you want a dog who... A German Pinscher may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A German Pinscher may not be right for you.

This breed is too smart to simply sit in the backyard or hang around the house doing nothing. Keep your German Pinscher happy and healthy by getting involved in agility (obstacle course for dogs), or advanced obedience classes. If you have small children, you should be aware that many German Pinschers don't tolerate any nonsense and are quick to react to teasing. Or even clumsiness such as accidental squeezing of their ears or stepping on their paw. Many German Pinschers are possessive of their food and toys and will defend these from all comers."
German Shepherds,"  German Shepherds were my very first breed. This noble-looking male has a beautiful rugged head, intelligent expression, and rich coloration. To understand a breed's temperament and behavior, ask, ""What was he developed to do?"" Whichever traits help him accomplish his intended work have likely been ""hard-wired"" into his genes – not perfectly, but generally. The German Shepherd was developed from various sheepherding dogs. So you would expect sheepherding traits such as athleticism, a compulsion to chase things that move, and swift responsiveness to their human shepherd/master. German Shepherds were also developed as military messenger and sentry dogs, and as personal protection and police dogs. So expect traits such as aloofness toward strangers and protective/territorial instincts. The breed also excels at search and rescue, bomb and drug detection, and guiding the blind. Certainly you would expect high intelligence, high self-confidence, trainability, and an ability to focus. All of those traits are what you get in an ideal German Shepherd. One of the most capable and trainable breeds in all of dogdom, an ideal German Shepherd, when properly raised by a confident owner, can be a magnificent companion. There's a good reason my first dogs were German Shepherds! Unfortunately, it can be difficult today to find a German Shepherd with an ideal temperament. Or at least an ideal temperament to be a good family companion. Today, the temperament of a German Shepherd often depends largely upon what kind of line he comes from. Some breeders, you see, produce working lines of German Shepherds with high-drive temperaments – vigorous and intense. These dogs are ideal for competitive protection-dog sports. But not so much for the average family companion, unless you were to look carefully for an individual pup in one of those litters who didn't inherit that high-drive temperament. Other breeders produce show lines that match a detailed standard of conformation for the show ring. These dogs are softer-tempered than those from working lines. That sounds nice and yet.... I've worked with far too many German Shepherds from show lines who were hyperactive, skittish, spooky, or downright dopey. This happens when breeders focus on appearance more than temperament and trainability. If you're looking for an easygoing family companion, I would avoid both strict show lines and strict working lines. Instead, you might look for more of a generalist breeder who focuses on calmness and high trainability. These breeders might prove their dogs' trainability by participating in non-protection dog sports such as obedience, rally, or agility. Or, if you want a truly mellow Shepherd, you might consider a longhaired or perhaps a solid white German Shepherd. These dogs are seldom bred for aggressive dog sports, so they tend to have a milder temperament that fits well into many families. Just be careful with the whites. A good number of them are too soft, which can result in timidity or skittishness. ....that with German Shepherds more than most other breeds, you must know what you want before you start calling breeders or looking at litters. Because if you don't know what you want, and what you don't want, and if you don't ask the right questions, you're likely to end up with a German Shepherd that isn't at all what you were looking for – and possibly one who is too much for you to handle.   Such an intelligent expression – confident and inquiring. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament  is less predictable than the inheritance of physical  traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training.

Some German Shepherds are considerably larger than that, but shouldn't be. This breed is supposed to be athletic and agile, not giant-sized and ponderous. Larger dogs can have more joint problems and a shorter lifespan.   Officially there's only the one breed. But I explained in the Temperament section that there are different lines of German Shepherds with different temperaments. Those lines can also LOOK very different from each other. Those of us who admired the strong, noble look of German Shepherds from decades ago are saddened at what has been done to the appearance of modern show dogs. If you go to a German Shepherd specialty show in the United States or Canada, you'll see tall narrow bodies, long narrow heads, and such excessive curvature of the rear legs that the dog's back slopes downward from shoulders to tail. You could roll a ball down that back. In my opinion, these are misshapen caricatures of a German Shepherd. To make matters worse, show lines produce more than their share of spooky and low-intelligence dogs, which is what happens when you over-focus on appearance rather than temperament and trainability. In contrast, the West German show line has a more normal shape. Best of all, German Shepherds in West Germany cannot win show ring ribbons or be bred without passing a temperament/trainability test. There are many West German bloodlines in the United States. So if you're interested, you can look for show breeders who emphasize West German lines instead of American/Canadian. Just be aware that these dogs aren't couch potatoes: they do have plenty of energy and some working drives that will need to be exercised. Solid black German Shepherds are less common, but when combined with a rugged build, makes for a very handsome dog. I love these lines because the dogs look and behave more like German Shepherds. It's true that working lines are often too strong-tempered and intense for the average family. But if you're an experienced owner who knows how to be in charge and if you provide firm rules and plenty of physical and mental exercise, working lines can make great companions. Knowledgeable working dog breeders can point you toward the pups in their litters who are calmer and have less working drive. In the United States, working lines stem predominantly from West Germany or East Germany. I don't recommend East German (often called DDR) lines. DDR stands for Deutsches Demokratische Republik, the name by which East Germany was known while the Berlin Wall was up. These dogs were used by the military and border patrol, so they're tough, not recommended for the average family. You might be thinking, ""Must I choose show line or working line? Isn't there another choice, like a line specifically bred to be a good pet?"" Some breeders blend show and working lines, trying to produce a more moderate build and temperament. Some breeders emphasize high trainability, competing with their intelligent dogs in non-protection sports such as obedience or agility. Other breeders emphasize ""old style"" German Shepherds with a more rugged build. But avoid breeders who boast about their ""giant"" German Shepherds. Packing more weight onto the frame and joints of a breed that's supposed to be medium to large is a huge (pun intended) mistake.  German Shepherd with long hair. This particular dog has a minimalist long coat – just some ear tufts and a body coat that's slightly longer than normal. When you're thinking about the different types of German Shepherds, you should also consider the two types of COAT: The normal coat is short hair. But German Shepherds also come in a longer coat. Both coats are the same breed. Unfortunately, in the United States, long coats are frowned upon by the official clubs and show-dog breeders. Long-coated dogs can be registered, bred, and shown in certain activities such as obedience and agility. But they're not welcome in the conformation ring, where judging is based on appearance. Some long-coated Shepherds have essentially a short body coat with only minor feathering around their ears, on the backs of their legs, and on their bum and tail. Other long-coated German Shepherds have long hair across most of their body. Do long haired German Shepherds have a different build or temperament? Yes, often they do. Because they're not welcome in the conformation ring, their structure hasn't been deformed like that of their shorthaired brothers. And because they're seldom seen in protection dog sports, their temperament tends to be softer and milder, which fits well into many families.   German Shepherds are active dogs, but should not be hyperactive. Fetch games are a great way to exercise this breed. German Shepherd puppies and adolescents (up to 18 months old) should have moderate exercise only – multiple walks, fetch games, or (if there is a compatible playmate) playing with another dog. But the growing bones and ligaments in a young dog can be irreparably damaged by too much exercise or the wrong kind of exercise. At this age, there should be no forced running (beside a jogger or bicyclist). Restrict jumping as much as possible. Once the dog is mature, the amount of exercise needed will vary according to the dog's energy level. But all German Shepherds, to maintain fitness, need brisk walking every day and all-out running in a safe, enclosed area as often as possible. Dogs from working lines typically want a lot more exercise. Mental exercise is even more important for German Shepherds. Mental exercise means the dog gets to participate in interesting activities that keep his intelligent mind stimulated. This might be a dog sport such as agility, rally obedience, musical freestyle, tracking, flyball, herding, or schutzhund. It might be interactive dog toys, or a homemade obstacle course, or learning tricks, or playing games such as Hide 'n Seek. Some of these activities are included in my training book, Teach Your Dog 100 English Words.   Handsome black German Shepherd, attentively awaiting your next words. Some are easy to train, while others are more moderate. As we've seen, different lines have different temperaments. German Shepherds from working lines are typically more assertive and stronger-willed. A ""tougher"" German Shepherd will be more challenging to train unless you pay closer attention to building the right Leader-Follower relationship with the dog. That doesn't mean ""softer"" German Shepherds are automatically easy to train. Some dogs with soft temperaments are skittish or shy, making them just as challenging as a strong-tempered dog. In general, though, a sound-tempered German Shepherd who is a good fit for family life should be easy to train. Just establish the right Leader-Follower relationship and the dog will be happy to work with you. This is taught in my puppy training book, Respect Training For Puppies (30 seconds to a calm, polite, well-behaved puppy). Or see my advice on → dog training   Most German Shepherds are reserved with strangers. As the breed's national club says, a good German Shepherd has: ""a certain aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships. The dog must be approachable, quietly standing its ground and showing confidence and willingness to meet overtures without itself making them."" As you might imagine, this can be a fine line to walk. Without proper guidance from the owner, a German Shepherd's natural aloofness can morph over the line to suspiciousness, distrust, and even aggression or fearfulness. When you own an aloof breed, you need to socialize the dog thoroughly. This means a careful program of teaching him to pay attention to you and mind you in the presence of other people and other dogs. He doesn't have to like them, but he must accept them. One thing I should mention: many German Shepherds who bark and lunge at strangers or other dogs aren't being either protective or aggressive. Rather, this kind of reactivity can be the dog's attempt to hide his own insecurities behind a blustering facade. At the other end of the spectrum are German Shepherds who tuck their tail between their legs, and try to hide behind you or run away whenever a stranger or another dog approaches. Sometimes this is just inexperience with the world, but sometimes it's an inherited form of shyness. German Shepherds who are genetically shy can be helped by socialization – but not ""cured."" Yet another reason to be very careful when acquiring this breed. There are also legal liabilities to consider when you acquire a German Shepherd. For example, your homeowner insurance policy might be cancelled or the rates hiked, because people are often quicker to sue if a ""guard dog breed"" does anything even remotely questionable.   If the dog was raised with childen and if the children are well-behaved, most German Shepherds with a normal temperament are fine with them. But if you have young children, you need to be especially careful about bringing an adult German Shepherd with an unknown background into your home. That dog should have a stellar temperament vouched for by experienced rescue personnel. Also I wouldn't be comfortable with some high-drive German Shepherds around toddlers. These vigorous, intense dogs could send a toddler flying without even meaning to.   Most German Shepherds are fine with other dogs and cats in their own family, if introduced to them when the dog is young. I've had multiple German Shepherds living harmoniously with my Chihuahuas and cats. However, some German Shepherds show strong predatory/chasing behavior toward cats and other animals that run. And some German Shepherds are dominant, or aggressive, toward other dogs of the same sex. My dog Luke, for example, would never dream of harming a female dog – but he would have loved to engage any strange male. Only a firm Respect Training program kept his behavior under control.   Long-coated German Shepherd. Keep their feathering combed out to avoid painful mats and tangles. I have good news and bad news. The good news is that German Shepherds have only one shedding period a year. The bad news is.... their shedding period lasts for 365 days. In other words, German Shepherds shed constantly. How is this different from most breeds? Most breeds shed a few hairs here and there throughout the year. But the vast bulk of their shedding occurs only twice a year – for three weeks in the spring as their thicker winter coat switches over to a cooler summer coat, and for three weeks in the fall as the summer coat switches over to a winter coat. Not German Shepherds. They shed a TON during those spring and fall coat-switching seasons. Plus they shed moderately the rest of the year. So year-round, you'll find hair on your clothing, on your carpets, and under your refrigerator. Frequent vaccuming will become a way of life. You might be wondering, ""How can a shorthaired dog shed so much?"" The answer is that German Shepherds have a double coat. They have a short outer coat (harsh to the touch), plus a woolly undercoat (for insulation). Breeds with a double coat always shed more than breeds who simply have an outer coat but no undercoat. German Shepherds come in a long coat, as well as a short coat. Both coats shed heavily. How much grooming is required depends on whether a German Shepherd is shorthaired or longhaired. We've already talked about the temperament (usually good) of longhaired German Shepherds. As far as grooming goes, they obviously need regular brushing and combing to prevent mats and tangles. The longer the coat, the more work it will be. But even if your Shepherd has a short coat, you're not off the hook when it comes to brushing. With a constant shedder, you should brush as often as possible to pull out the shed hairs before they end up on your floor and furnishings. Ironically, longhaired German Shepherds often seem to shed less than the shorthaired. That's because some shed hair gets caught in the long coat instead of falling out. The trade-off is that you need to brush out that accumulated hair regularly or it will tangle and fuse into a matted mess. Along with brushing and combing, longhaired German Shepherds need trimming every few months. Focus on the longish hair around the dog's private parts. Otherwise whenever he goes to the bathroom, the result is going to be unsanitary, both for the dog and for your house. Remember, anything that sticks to long hair eventually ends up on your floor or furnishings. So keep your dog's private parts trimmed short.   Gray sable pattern German Shepherds typically live 10-12 years. Some do live to 13 or 14, but usually with chronic health issues such as arthritis. And sadly, many don't even make it to age 10. As a long-time German Shepherd owner, I know first-hand how many health problems this breed suffers from. Crippling joint diseases, autoimmune diseases, digestive diseases, skin diseases, heart and eye diseases.... truly a breed with serious health problems. It's a good idea to have pet insurance when you own a German Shepherd. Here is a complete list of health problems in German Shepherds. See my advice on → keeping your dog healthy
(feeding, vaccinations, neutering, veterinarians, and more).   The most common color in German Shepherds – black and tan, in the saddleback pattern The most common colors are black and tan, black and red, black and cream, or black and silver. These colors cover the dog in one of these three patterns: Another common color is sable, which is an overall shade of gray, golden, or red, with black-tipped hairs that create a ""dusted with black"" effect. A less common, but perfectly acceptable, color is solid black. Then there are two controversial colors: blue and liver: If a dog has inherited either of these color-modifying genes, all of his black pigment is changed to blue/gray or brown, including his nose and the pads of his feet. For example, if a German Shepherd would have been a black and tan saddleback – except that he inherited a modifying gene – he becomes a blue and tan saddleback, or a liver and tan saddleback. Blue and liver are considered serious faults by the official German Shepherd clubs and breeders who show their dogs in the conformation ring. But you can still register these dogs and compete with them in activities such as obedience and agility. As with blue and liver, you can register a white German Shepherd and show him in competitive activities such as obedience and agility. But you can't show him in the conformation ring. Why? Well, the Powers-That-Be say white is an unacceptable color because German Shepherds were developed to be herding and guard dogs. White dogs, they say, are too visible to make effective guard dogs. On the other hand, white dogs blend in too much with the sheep or snow instead of being clearly visible to the human shepherd. If you love the white color, you might be pleased to hear that White Shepherd enthusiasts have formed their own club, which holds its own conformation shows.  Ah, you're thinking about cropping, a surgical procedure to make the ears stand up. That's done with Doberman Pinschers, but not with German Shepherds. A Shepherd puppy's ears prick up naturally – they're never cropped. German Shepherd puppy with perfectly normal ears at this age. If the pup inherited normal genes, the other ear should come up shortly. But German Shepherd puppies aren't born with pricked ears. In some pups, the ears start to prick up at 6 or 8 weeks old, while others don't start until 12 or 14 weeks old. Often the ears don't go up smoothly. In other words, they don't suddenly pop straight up. Typically one ear will go up halfway, and stay like that for a few days. Then the other ear may start to prick while the first ear straightens all the way up. A few days later, just as the second ear straightens up, the first one suddenly flops back down. This can be a trying time for new owners who worry that their pup's ears will never stand properly. Rest assured, it's normal for German Shepherd puppy ears to go up and down for a month or two, especially during the teething period. Unfortunately, some puppies do inherit poor genes for ear strength and often those ears will never come all the way up. They're called ""soft ears."" Sometimes taping a weak ear can help it stand erect, but often not. I had a German Shepherd with one soft ear. It flopped sideways on top of his head, while the other ear stood up beautifully. Of course I loved him dearly anyway!   Most German Shepherd puppies start out with floppy ears and dark coloration. Congratulations! I'll be happy to show you how to raise and train your new family member. I can help you with that, too. German Shepherds are extremely common in the United States, the 2nd most common of all breeds. So they're very easy to find. The problem is finding one with the best chances of developing a stable temperament and the best chances of staying healthy through the years. THAT is harder to do. First, you need to think about the different types of German Shepherds we talked about earlier. The different temperament types and the different build and coat types. You'll remember... show lines, working lines, old-style lines, longhaired lines, solid white lines.... one German Shepherd can be very different from another. Or you can just hop onto Craigslist and buy a puppy from someone who ""just breeds pets"" or ""just had one litter."" But should you? Not unless the seller has done the proper health certifications on the puppy's parents. One huge difference between a responsible breeder and an irresponsible ""puppy producer"" is – health certifications. Both parents of a German Shepherd puppy should have OFA certificates for hips, elbows, and heart. One parent should have a certificate showing them to be clear of degenerative myelopathy. This is the fastest way to rule out all the bad breeders. No certificates equals irresponsible breeding. BOTH PARENTS of a German Shepherd puppy should have: Also, at least ONE PARENT of a German Shepherd puppy should have: If a seller can't show you those certificates, the puppies are higher risk for health problems. You might choose to accept that risk. But then you need to be willing (and able) to pay a couple thousand bucks for future surgeries and lifelong meds if your German Shepherd ends up crippled, paralyzed, or stricken with heart disease. See my advice on → finding  a good dog   Because of their popularity, and because so many owners acquire one without doing diligent research, German Shepherds are often available from dog rescue groups. German Shepherd crosses and mixes are frequently found in animal shelters. However, shelter personnel can be over-zealous in labeling every medium- to large dog with a vaguely shepherd-ish look as a ""German Shepherd cross."" Be aware that a dog can look like a German Shepherd without having any Shepherd genes at all. Did you know there's a quick and simple DNA test that can tell you definitively which breeds make up any given dog?   The Shiloh Shepherd looks like a large German Shepherd, which is not surprising since the Shiloh was developed 50 years ago by crossing German Shepherds with larger breeds. Compared to German Shepherds, Shiloh Shepherds tend to have a calmer, more easygoing personality. Compared to German Shepherds, most White Shepherds have a softer, more sensitive personality. White Shepherds are fine watchdogs, but seldom aggressive. In fact, if a White Shepherd is going to have any temperament fault, it's more likely to be timidity or skittishness. The Belgian Shepherd is recommended only for experienced owners. Compared to the German Shepherd, a Belgian is more agile, graceful, and elegant. Belgian Shepherds are highly intelligent, but also easily bored and prone to obsessive behaviors. This is a demanding breed that needs ongoing supervision and structured activities."
German Shorthaired Pointers," Good-natured and adaptable, but primarily bred to be a hunting dog, the German Shorthaired Pointer has a high energy level and belongs with an equally athletic owner who will take him running, biking, or hiking. A walk around the block is barely a warm-up for a vigorous German Shorthaired Pointer. Too much confinement can lead to barking, hyperactivity, and destructive chewing. Toward strangers he may be very friendly or somewhat reserved, so his alarm bark may be welcoming or mildly protective. But this is NOT an aggressive breed. Most German Shorthairs are good with other pets, but some can be aggressive with strange dogs, and some are determined cat chasers. Obedience training is a must for instilling self-discipline and control, for this breed can be a bundle of intense energy. Fortunately he is eminently trainable . . . but he does not obey blindly. Indeed, though the German Shorthaired Pointer can become focused when required to do so, he is easily distracted and does know his own mind and you need to be both patient and firm. If you want a dog who... A German Shorthaired Pointer may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A German Shorthaired Pointer may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the German Shorthaired Pointer If I was considering a German Shorthaired Pointer, I would be most concerned about... If you simply want a pet for your family, and don't have the time or inclination to take your dog running or hiking or biking or swimming, or to get involved in hunting, or agility (obstacle course) classes, or advanced obedience, I do not recommend this breed (unless you adopt an older adult with a mellow temperament)."
German Wirehaired Pointers," The AKC Standard says, ""An intelligent, energetic, and determined hunter."" ""Hunter"" is a key word there. The German Wirehaired Pointer is steady and sensible, but also rugged and busy. He has a high energy level and belongs with an equally athletic owner who will take him running, biking, and hiking and preferably work him in the field. Too much confinement and too little attention can lead to barking, hyperactivity, and destructive chewing. Though some German Wirehaired Pointers are outgoing and friendly, most are rather aloof with strangers and can be protective (though not usually aggressive). With people, that is! With strange dogs, the German Wirehaired Pointer CAN be aggressive (or at least dominant and bold), and with his strong hunting instincts, some individuals are sharp with cats. This breed is strong-willed and determined and needs an owner who knows how to lead. Usually he is more serious and discriminating than his German Shorthair cousin, though many do have a clownish side. German Wirehaired Pointers are not for the fastidious household: They are sloppy drinkers, their beard soaking up water and depositing it as a trail of drips across your floor. If you want a dog who... A German Wirehaired Pointer may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A German Wirehaired Pointer may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the German Wirehaired Pointer If I was considering a German Wirehaired Pointer, I would be most concerned about... You should be an active outdoors lover interested in hunting or hiking, or taking your dog running with you. However, running is risky exercise for dogs unless it is done after the dog's bones and joints are fully mature, and only on a soft surface like dirt. Dogs should not be run on pavement, and young dogs should not be run at all."
Giant Schnauzers," The AKC Standard calls the Giant Schnauzer ""a bold and valiant figure of a dog – amiable in repose and a commanding figure when aroused."" Keen expression is what you may notice first about the Giant Schnauzer. This sensitive dog seems always aware of your moods and likes to be physically close to you, watching you. Some lines are ""harder-tempered"" (bold, serious, vigorous) while others are much sweeter and more mellow. But in general, when you acquire a Giant Schnauzer puppy, you should expect him to mature into an athletic, energetic dog who plays hard and needs a mile or two of walking and/or running each day. Mental stimulation is just as important to this extremely intelligent dog. Most Giant Schnauzers are watchful with strangers and responsible about protecting their home. However, timidity, skittishness, and sharp-shyness are seen in some lines. To promote a stable, confident temperament, Giant Schnauzers need more socialization than many other breeds. Many individuals are too spirited for small children, and some become overprotective of their own kids when a group is engaging in rough-and-tumble play. Strange dogs may well be challenged by your Giant Schnauzer. Cats may or may not be accepted. Once you establish your leadership, the Giant Schnauzer responds very well to obedience training that is fair and consistent. But this highly intelligent, strong-minded working breed is often ""too much dog"" for many households. If you want a dog who... A Giant Schnauzer may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Giant Schnauzer may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Giant Schnauzer If I was considering a Giant Schnauzer, I would be most concerned about... Some Giant Schnauzers go in the opposite direction -- without enough socialization, they become fearful of strangers. Fearfulness in a Giant Schnauzer can also be dangerous because it can lead to defensive biting if the dog becomes frightened and feels cornered."
Glen of Imaal Terriers," A sturdy dog with strong working instincts, the Glen of Imaal Terrier has a rough-and-ready appearance that belies his calm disposition. The heavily muscled Glen is surprisingly fast and agile, spirited and playful. He likes vigorous games and long walks and must be on-leash or loosed in a safe, enclosed area, because he is a hunter and chaser. Indoors he wants to be near you -- resting his head on your lap or feet -- so is often underfoot. Yet his general nature is patient, laid-back, and undemanding, unusual for a terrier. Glens are polite with known visitors, but other dogs may be another matter. Early socialization and owner control and attentiveness are recommended. With his high prey drive, the Glen of Imaal Terrier must be carefully introduced to cats and should not be kept with rabbits or rodents. Glens have the stubborn character of a true terrier, but they are quite willing to work with you if you use praise and food to motivate them. With his enthusiasm, low center of gravity, and tremendous strength, the Glen of Imaal Terrier will tow you along the street unless you teach him how to walk on a leash. He is a powerful digger and has a surprisingly deep bark. If you want a dog who... A Glen of Imaal Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Glen of Imaal Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

To teach your Glen to listen to you, ""Respect Training"" is mandatory. Read more about Glen of Imaal Training."
Golden Retrievers," The Golden Retriever's kindly expression says it all. This is one of the finest family dogs in the world: cheerful, demonstrative, trustworthy with everyone, and forgiving of any mistakes made by inexperienced owners. Give this breed two brisk walks each day, play fetch games, and take him out for a good run once a week, and he is adaptable to almost any lifestyle. Friendly with everyone (strangers, children, dogs, cats, smaller pets), his bark is welcoming rather than protective. You must control his tendency to chew on objects and to mouth your hands -- provide a box filled with toys so he can carry things around in his mouth. A Golden Retriever remains enthusiastically puppy-like for many years, so early obedience training is required to instill calmness and good manners. Eager to please and wonderfully responsive, he is nonetheless distracted by exciting sights and sounds, so you must be both patient and persistent. The mind and heart of a Golden is sweet and gentle, but his body is robust -- until he's taught not to pull on the leash, you'll need good biceps to walk him. If you want a dog who... A Golden Retriever may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Golden Retriever may not be right for you.

Gordon Setters," The handsome, well-muscled Gordon Setter is the most alert, serious, and sensible of the setters, a graceful yet powerful dog who enjoys hiking, biking, jogging, and field work as regular exercise. Though usually calm and dignified, with a wise and noble expression, the Gordon Setter does have a silly side, and also a demanding side. Gordon Setters thrive on one-on-one attention, you see. They can be jealous of other pets and are sometimes aggressive toward strange dogs. The strong-mindedness of the Gordon Setter calls for early training by someone who knows how to establish and stick to rules, but you must be patient and persuasive, never harsh. Gordon Setters also have long memories: Once they learn something (whether right or wrong), they'll remember it for a long time. On the negative side, this means bad habits can be difficult to break. If you want a dog who... A Gordon Setter may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Gordon Setter may not be right for you.

Great Danes," The Great Dane is typically a gentle giant, easygoing and mild-mannered. He needs only moderate exercise, but does need space and shouldn't be cramped into studio apartments and postage-stamp yards. Above all, this sociable breed needs companionship. He doesn't do well when left alone. With his deep, resounding voice, a Great Dane won't fail to announce visitors, but guarding and territorial instincts vary. Some lines and individuals are friendly with everyone, some are sensibly protective, while others are standoffish or skittish. To build their confidence and promote a stable temperament, young Great Danes must be taken out into the world more frequently than most other breeds. Some Great Danes are peaceful with other pets, while others are dominant and pushy. Because he is so huge and can be bossy if undisciplined, obedience training is essential, but Great Danes are also very sensitive and should be trained with cheerful methods. Harshness only confuses them and makes them distrustful. Great Danes drool and slobber and lumber around in a rather bumptious manner. They are not good choices for fastidious housekeepers, or for those with no sense of humor. Young Great Danes (up to three years old) can be boisterous, and unless supervised, will dismay you with the magnitude of their destructiveness. If you want a dog who... A Great Dane may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Great Dane may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Great Dane If I was considering a Great Dane, I would be most concerned about... Since you need to minimize their exercise, young Great Danes can be very rambunctious. They will romp with uncoordinated gawkiness all over your house. You need to substitute extra quantities of companionship and supervision. Otherwise, left alone, young Great Danes become bored and destructive. Their powerful jaws can destroy your living room. Without careful socialization, a Great Dane may be suspicious of everyone. This can lead to either aggression or shyness, and both attitudes are dangerous in a giant breed. Fearful Danes can bite defensively if they feel cornered. And it's no fun trying to drag a frightened dog along by the leash in public."
Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs," As with most giant breeds, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog doesn't need hours of hard running. Yet he is much more athletic than you might think, so he definitely needs regular moderate exercise. Pulling a cart or sled is a wonderful productive outlet for his energy, especially when children are involved. Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs thrive on your companionship, though their determination to jump up into your face, shove their body against your leg, or slap a massive paw into your lap can be disconcerting. This vigilant watchdog will sound off in a loud, deep voice to announce visitors – or simply to let you know that your neighbor has stepped outdoors. Most Swissys are friendly with guests, but some are more wary, and some are shy and spooky. Early and ongoing socialization is essential to develop a stable Greater Swiss Mountain Dog. Some Swissys are peaceful with other animals. Others have a high prey drive and aren't safe with small animals such as cats, while still others are downright aggressive with strange dogs. Obedience training should start at three months old and include praise and food. Walking nicely on a leash is an imperative lesson, for these powerful dogs can literally pull you off your feet. During adolescence when their hormones will kick in, many Swissys, especially males, will start to test your rules. You must respond with assertive, consistent leadership. Slower to mature (both physically and mentally) than many other breeds, the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog remains playfully puppy-like for many years. This sounds delightful, but can wear away your patience when that ""puppy"" weighs over 100 pounds! For example, you must control the tendency of this breed to mouth your hands. Similarly, he may try to ingest everything in his path, from sticks to gravel. Frankly, with all of his special needs, the Greater Swiss is ""too much dog"" for the average household. If you want a dog who... A Greater Swiss Mountain Dog may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Greater Swiss Mountain Dog may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

Great Pyrenees," The AKC Standard describes the Great Pyrenees as ""strong willed, independent, and somewhat reserved, yet attentive, fearless, and loyal to his charges – both human and animal."" A majestic-looking dog with a kindly, regal expression, the Great Pyrenees is calm, composed, and serious. As an adult, he is quiet indoors and content with long daily walks and regular opportunities to stretch out. He does love to romp in the snow, and pulling a cart or carrying a backpack gives him a purpose in life. Aloof with strangers, he should be accustomed to many different people in his early months. The Great Pyrenees is patient with his own family's children, but some are overprotective when neighbors join in for rough-and-tumble play. Likewise, he may be protective of his own family's pets while aggressively driving off others. These characteristics stem from his background as a livestock guardian, where he was expected to keep watch over the flock, making his own decisions about friends and foes and appropriate actions. Unless you establish yourself as the alpha (number one), the Great Pyrenees will trust his own judgment and do whatever he pleases. This breed is not an eager-to-please Golden Retriever. Great Pyrenees have a deep, impressive bark, which they tend to use freely, especially at night when they are most vigilant. Fences must be secure, for Pyrs have a tendency to roam. Some produce ""slime"" (excessive saliva). If you want a dog who... A Great Pyrenees may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Great Pyrenees may not be right for you.

Only certain living situations can provide the activities that keep this breed content."
Greyhounds," The Greyhound belongs to a family of hunting dogs called sighthounds. The slender, long-legged sighthound hunts by spotting the movement of a prey animal across a vast distance, then running the animal down with lightning speed. The Greyhound, though, is a unique sighthound developed more for track racing than for hunting. Greyhound racing is a high-stakes, brutal industry that is fortunately being banned in more and more communities. Greyhound racing dogs who are past their prime, or who simply lose too many races, would face quick deaths if it weren't for rescue groups who take them in and foster them. Greyhound Rescue groups teach these ex-racing dogs (who have lived their entire lives in kennels) how to be good family companions. The vast majority of Greyhounds found in family homes today are ex-racing dogs. With their quiet dignity and independence, Greyhounds are calm and quiet indoors, moving lightly and gracefully rather than toppling your lamps. They are comfort-loving dogs who want to snuggle on a soft couch or under a warm blanket. The fastest of all breeds (a Greyhound can outrun a horse in a sprint), once he has exploded into his powerful driving gallop for a short time, he is content to sleep for the rest of the day. Which brings up an important requirement for owning a Greyhound – you should have a good-sized, fenced area in which he can spring all-out at least once every few days. Greyhounds are not built for endurance, so they don't want or need hours of jogging exercise. This sensitive breed prefers peace and quiet and soft-spoken people. He does not do well in an environment with chronic tension or loud voices. Most Greyhounds are politely reserved with strangers, and prefer to lean against their owner's leg rather than approaching people they don't know. Greyhounds are peaceful with other dogs who are medium to large in size. But because of their heritage, they can be a serious chaser of cats and tiny dogs. However, many individuals can learn to coexist with these smaller pets. Greyhounds are nonaggressive (they tend to freeze when challenged or attacked) and they can be touch-sensitive (startling when touched unexpectedly). Because they are so docile, they must be trained with a very light hand and much more praise than correction. This quiet dog seldom barks. (But many individuals take great delight in stealing and hoarding food and toys!) If you want a dog who... A Greyhound may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Greyhound may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Greyhound If I was considering a Greyhound, I would be most concerned about... See if there is a dog club in your area that offers an activity called lure coursing, which is chasing a mechanical lure in a controlled setting. This is an appropriate outlet for the full-speed galloping behaviors that are ""hardwired"" into your Greyhound's genes. Fortunately, most Greyhounds today are placed in their new homes by Greyhound rescue organizations. These groups have already done rigorous screening to evaluate each dog's behavioral tendencies. They are experienced at predicting whether any given Greyhound will be reliable with your cats, for example. Honestly, though, I don't know that I would feel comfortable keeping a Greyhound with one of my cats or toy-breed dogs. Should you consider a Greyhound if you have young children? It depends on the individual dog and the individual children. These sensitive dogs often feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making – and stress and shyness may be the result. Realistically, the final decision won't be up to you, since Greyhound rescue groups have their own policies about children. Personally I prefer to recommend Greyhounds for adult-only homes."
Havanese," One of the brightest and sturdiest of the toys, the Havanese is happy and playful and enjoys clever games of dexterity such as ""pull the hidden toy from under the cabinet with your paw."" Havanese are very people-oriented dogs, love snuggling in laps, and can be overly dependent -- they don't do well at all when left for long periods of time without companionship. ""Not doing well"" means unhappiness and boredom, which they may try to vent through barking and destructive chewing. Though peaceful and gentle with everyone (humans and other pets), the Havanese can be conservative with strangers. Socialization is important to build a confident, outgoing temperament, as there is a potential for excessive caution/timidity. Havanese do have an independent streak, but they are not a dominant breed. They respond well to training that includes food rewards and they especially love learning tricks. Many individuals excel in competitive obedience and agility. The most problematic training issue is housebreaking -- Havanese are slow to housetrain. Barking needs to be curtailed, as well. Many Havanese like to perch on the high back of a sofa or chair, looking out the window so they can announce visitors. If you want a dog who... A Havanese may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Havanese may not be right for you.

Other concerns in the breed are urinary problems and bladder stones, along with loose knee joints that may require surgery. Read more about Havanese Health."
Ibizan Hounds," The AKC Standard says, ""Lithe and racy, the Ibizan possesses a deerlike elegance combined with the power of a hunter."" The Ibizan Hound, affectionately called ""Beezer"", belongs to a family of dogs called sighthounds. The slender, long-legged sighthound is a hunting breed that spots the movement of prey across a vast distance, and runs it down with lightning speed. Once past the boisterous puppy stage, the sleek Ibizan Hound is quiet, gentle, and relaxed indoors and can be a couch potato. However, true to his heritage, he is also a swift and athletic dog who needs running exercise in a safe, enclosed area. He loves to leap, and he is incredibly graceful and light on his feet, without equal as a high-jumper and broad-jumper. Fences must be at least six feet high – and food stored on top of the refrigerator is not out of his reach! Polite but watchful with strangers, the Ibizan Hound does need early and extensive socialization to develop a confident, outgoing personality. Most are effective watchdogs and some have protective instincts, which is unusual for a sighthound. ""Beezers"" are good with other dogs, but likely to pursue (and unfortunately catch....) smaller pets who run. The Ibizan Hound learns quickly and enjoys activities such as obedience and agility (when they are made interesting and challenging), but he is a freethinker who doesn't obey mindlessly. He must be handled calmly and persuasively and motivated with food and praise, for he is sensitive to sharp corrections. Sighthounds can be touch-sensitive, startling when touched unexpectedly or wrapped up in someone's arms.

See if there is a dog club in your area that offers an activity called lure coursing, which is chasing a mechanical lure in a controlled setting. This is an appropriate outlet for the full-speed galloping behaviors that are ""hardwired"" into your Ibizan Hound's genes. All that said, if you're interested in canine sports like competitive obedience or agility (obstacle course), Ibizan Hounds are one of the best choices of the sighthounds. They're not top-notch competition dogs like Border Collies and Golden Retrievers! But if you treat these sports like fun games, Ibizan Hounds learn readily. Read more about Ibizan Hound Training. If you have toddlers, I don't recommend an Ibizan Hound. These sensitive dogs can feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making – and stress and shyness may be the result."
Irish Setters," Did you think Irish Setters only came in red? Surprise! They also come in a handsome red-and-white pattern. The elegant Irish Setter has been described as rollicking, happy-go-lucky, clownish, impulsive, flighty, and demonstrative. This lively dog can be a destructive handful during the gawky adolescent stage – which lasts two or three years. But given sufficient exercise and obedience training to instill good manners, adults gradually become more dignified and aristocratic. The sociable Irish Setter gets along well with everyone, including other pets. Indeed, he requires a good deal of companionship and doesn't thrive if left alone too much. Though he has a willful streak and is easily distracted by exciting sights and smells (remember, this is a hunting dog!), the Irish Setter is probably the most willing to please of the three setter breeds. You must be both patient and persistent when training setters, but never harsh, because these dogs are physically and emotionally sensitive. And they have long memories: once they learn something (whether right or wrong), they'll remember it for a long time. This means bad habits can be difficult to break and harsh handling is not easily forgotten. If you want a dog who... An Irish Setter may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Irish Setter may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

Irish Terriers," The AKC Standard says, ""There is a heedless, reckless pluck about the Irish Terrier which...coupled with the headlong dash, blind to all consequences, with which he rushes at his adversary, has earned for the breed the proud epithet of Daredevil."" One of the boldest and most animated of the terriers, this fearless breed, built on lines of speed with a graceful, racy outline, must often be protected from himself. Energetic and intense, he romps and plays with vigor and will take as much exercise as you can offer. Leashes and secure fences are compulsory, for he is exceedingly fast and agile, with strong chasing, digging, and jumping instincts. The Irish Terrier does best with active families, for without exercise and lots of companionship and personal interaction, he will become bored and seek to entertain himself -- and his choices usually involve mischief and destructiveness. His reaction to strangers varies from polite to aloof, and even the polite ones are vigilant watchdogs. Early socialization is important for a stable, controlled temperament. The Irish Terrier can be exceedingly scrappy with other animals, whether canine or feline, and will make short shrift of rabbits and rodents. Stubborn and self-assured, he is inclined to test for position in the family pecking order. If you want a dog who... An Irish Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Irish Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Irish Terrier If I was considering an Irish Terrier, I would be most concerned about... Irish Terriers are active go-getters. They require a fenced yard, plenty of companionship throughout the day, and regular opportunities to do interesting things (games and activities). But terriers should not be trusted off-leash. They will take off after anything that runs. Irish Terriers must be taught at an early age that they are not the rulers of the world. The toughness that makes them suited to killing vermin can frustrate you when you try to teach them anything. Terriers can be stubborn and dominant and will make you prove that you can make them do things. You must show them, through absolute consistency, that you mean what you say. Read more about Irish Terrier Training. I do not recommend Irish Terriers around small children. Many terriers will not tolerate any nonsense from little life forms whom they consider to be below themselves in importance. Many terriers are quick to react to teasing, and even to the normal clumsiness that comes with small children (accidental squeezing of their ears or pulling of whiskers or stepping on their paw). Many terriers are possessive of their food and toys and will defend these from all comers."
Irish Water Spaniels," The AKC Standard says, ""Great intelligence is combined with rugged endurance and a bold, dashing eagerness."" The tallest of the spaniels, with a unique quizzical expression, the Irish Water Spaniel has a distinct, purposeful presence. He varies in personality more than some other breeds, but most are bold, inquisitive, and eager to play. Irish Water Spaniels need plenty of vigorous exercise, including retrieving and swimming. He should be accustomed to a variety of people and new situations at an early age, as he tends to be reserved and often protective, and these traits could easily slide into shyness or sharpness. Irish Water Spaniels can be aggressive with strange dogs, sometimes even with other pets. Most have strong opinions and are not hesitant about expressing them, yet he is capable of learning a great deal from an owner who knows how to lead. Handled properly and given outlets for his exuberance, the Irish Water Spaniel is a fun-loving, extremely perceptive dog. However, this is not a breed to be teased or ignored, nor one to be chosen by a nonassertive owner. If you want a dog who... An Irish Water Spaniel may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Irish Water Spaniel may not be right for you.

More traits and characteristics of the Irish Water Spaniel If I was considering an Irish Water Spaniel, I would be most concerned about... Without enough opportunities to vent his energy and do interesting things, an Irish Water Spaniel is likely to become rambunctious and bored, which dogs usually express by barking and destructive chewing."
Irish Wolfhounds," The AKC Standard says, ""Of great size and commanding appearance, the Irish Wolfhound is remarkable in combining power and swiftness with sight."" This gentle giant is sometimes calm and dignified, sometimes playful and silly, always easygoing and reliable. The Irish Wolfhound does best in a suburban or country home with lots of companionship and room to stretch out. He needs regular exercise to stay fit, whether he seems to want it or not. A daily one-hour walk/trot (on-leash) with twice weekly gallops inside a safe enclosed area are necessary for proper development. Sensible with strangers, most Irish Wolfhounds are friendly and expect to be petted, while some are more wary. This breed does need early, frequent socialization to encourage an outgoing attitude. Not many individuals are guardians; indeed, suspiciousness or aggressiveness should never be encouraged because of his massive size. With other animals the Irish Wolfhound is usually amiable, but he does love to chase, tackle, and pounce on anything that moves rapidly. A sweet and sensitive dog, he has his independent side but responds well (slowly and thoughtfully) to patient obedience training. Use positive rewards rather than heavy-handed jerking. Irish Wolfhounds remain gawky, clumsy, and potentially destructive (in a big way!) for up to three years. If you want a dog who... An Irish Wolfhound may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Irish Wolfhound may not be right for you.

Since you need to minimize their exercise, young Irish Wolfhounds can be very rambunctious. They will romp with uncoordinated gawkiness all over your house. You need to substitute extra quantities of companionship and supervision. Otherwise, left alone, young Irish Wolfhounds become bored and destructive and their powerful jaws can literally destroy your living room. To teach your Irish Wolfhound to listen to you, ""Respect Training"" is mandatory. Read more about Irish Wolfhound Training."
Italian Greyhounds," The Italian Greyhound is sweet-natured and gentle, yet also exceptionally playful and athletic. This warmth-seeking, comfort-loving dog can usually be found basking in sunspots or snuggled into soft furniture, often hidden under a blanket, pillow, or towel. When you own an Italian Greyhound, you need to watch where you sit! But if this breed sounds like the perfect couch potato . . . he isn't! In between his placid snuggles, Italian Greyhounds will suddenly explode into a burst of vigorous running and leaping, tearing pell-mell around the house or yard, darting and zigzagging at breakneck speeds and literally bouncing off the walls, fence, sofa, or beds. Perching themselves up high on the back of your sofa to better see out the window, young Italian Greyhounds are notorious for breaking their long fragile legs as they launch themselves fearlessly into space and crash to the floor. Their spurts of reckless abandon can be nerve-wracking to live with! The same is true outdoors. A yard that hopes to contain an Italian Greyhound should have a high (at least six-foot fence), because this racy, agile breed is a fantastic jumper. Off-leash walks would be foolish for a similar reason: he can be out of sight in seconds. Polite (often a bit aloof) with strangers, there is potential for timidity, so he should be socialized early and thoroughly. The Italian Greyhound is amiable with other dogs and cats, but some have a high prey drive and will run squeaky creatures into the ground. IGs (pronounced eye-jees) or Iggies are mildly stubborn and very sensitive. They respond favorably only to gentle, upbeat training methods that emphasize cheerful praise and food rewards. Physical corrections upset them because they can be ""touch-sensitive"", startling when touched unexpectedly or grabbed suddenly (one reason I don't recommend these dogs for young children). Italian Greyhounds have marvellously quirky, inquisitive, demanding personalities that are unique from other breeds. With all of their special needs, they are not good choices for inexperienced dog owners. Housebreaking is especially difficult, as Italian Greyhounds often refuse to go outside in the cold or rain. Some owners build special (large) litterboxes for their Italian Greyhound, or teach him to use a doggy door that leads out to a COVERED and PROTECTED potty yard. If you want a dog who... An Italian Greyhound may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Italian Greyhound may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Italian Greyhound If I was considering an Italian Greyhound, I would be most concerned about... Italian Greyhound puppies are not suited to small children, no matter how well-meaning the child. Children cannot help being clumsy, and that a child meant well is little solace to an Italian Greyhound puppy who has been accidentally stepped on or squeezed too hard. Even Italian Greyhound adults often feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making – and stress and shyness may be the result."
Spinone Italiano," The Spinone Italiano Club says: ""Everything about this breed suggests great strength."" Kind and patient in the home, the Italian Spinone is a serious, tireless hunting machine in the field. Though he looks gruff, rather like a wise old grandfather, the Spinone is happy and playful, even clownish. Youngsters can be restless and require lots of attention, but adults are calm and laid-back, as long as they are given sufficient daily exercise, including swimming if possible. Remember that this is a hunting breed, not an apartment decoration. This sweet-natured dog needs lots of early exposure to people and strange sights and sounds. When well socialized, he may turn out quite friendly or remain a bit cautious, yet poised. Most Spinoni get along well with other animals, especially other dogs. Some individuals have a higher prey drive and will pester cats. The Spinone Italiano has an independent mind and can be stubborn, but this is not a dominant dog who needs (or who can withstand) strong-arm training methods. He can be a jumper and digger, so make sure fences are secure. Some individuals drool, especially around food and water. If you want a dog who... A Spinone Italiano may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Spinone Italiano may not be right for you.

Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Spinone Italiano If I was considering an Italian Spinone, I would be most concerned about... If you don't provide enough physical and mental exercise AND a good deal of companionship, the Spinone will express his unhappiness through destructive chewing and barking. In other words, you must teach your Spinone Italiano to respect you. A dog who respects you will do what you say and will stop what he's doing when you tell him ""No."" Read more about Spinone Italiano Training."
Jack Russell Terriers," If any dog can top the high energy level of a Fox Terrier, it might be a Jack Russell. If any dog can top the hard-as-nails hunting skills of a Border Terrier, it might be a Jack Russell. And if any dog can top the strong prey drive, determination, and intensity of a Jack Russell Terrier – well, that could only be another Jack Russell. This bright, clever, athletic breed is on top of everything that's going on in his environment. Nothing gets by him. A solitary or sedate lifestyle is not suited to a Jack Russell Terrier. He requires full participation in the family and vigorous daily play sessions, especially ball chasing, which he tends to be passionate about – even obsessive. Too little exercise, too little companionship, and too little mental stimulation will quickly lead to boredom, which will in turn lead to destructive behaviors. JRTs are not apartment dogs, nor are they suited to people who work a lot. Most Jack Russell Terriers are happy-go-lucky and friendly with strangers. But in the presence of strange dogs, keep them close and under control. If the other dog minds its own manners, the Jack Russell will usually adhere to a ""live and let live"" philosphy. But some Jack Russells are so brash and fearless they will take on a Rottweiler if it even looks cross-eyed at them. Two Jack Russell Terriers (regardless of sex or age) should never be left alone together. All may appear to go well for a while – even a long while. But with this breed, a seemingly amiable relationship can suddenly flare into deadly combat over something as innocuous as possession of a chew toy. If you keep two Jack Russells, it is safest to separate them when you leave the house. As you've probably guessed by now, small pets that run, squeak, or flutter probably won't last an hour. The exploratory and hunting instincts of Jack Russell Terriers are legendary. These dogs will ""go to ground"" after anything that moves and they will stay in or by the hole for hours, even days. Obviously, JRTs are enthusiastic diggers and barkers! The Jack Russell Terrier is highly intelligent and can learn almost anything – very, very quickly. The hardest part of training a Jack Russell is convincing this cheerful but assertive little guy that he actually has to DO what he has learned, when you say so, even when he's not in the mood. Fortunately, if you are offering the correct mix of physical exercise, mental stimulation, companionship hours, and confident leadership, the Jack Russell is usually willing to oblige. Now it is possible to find a mild-mannered, laid-back Jack Russell. When you're looking for an adult dog from a rescue group, they might have a purebred or mixed Jack Russell who is more mellow. But this temperament is not the norm for the breed, so if you get a puppy, he or she is likely to grow up to have the active go-getter temperament I've been describing. If you want a dog who... A Parson Jack Russell Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Parson Jack Russell Terrier may not be right for you.

See my book, Teach Your Dog 100 English Words (below), for a dynamic training program that will keep your Jack Russell on his toes!"
Japanese Chin," Perky, proud, and playful, the elegant Japanese Chin is less hyperactive and less yappy than many other toy breeds. Though he does love to play in the yard, he doesn't need much more exercise than that. The yard must be fenced, for he has a spaniel heritage with just enough hunting instincts to chase birds or butterflies into the street. A lover of comfort, the Japanese Chin enjoys cuddling on laps and snuggling into soft pillows, his soulful eyes inviting pampering, which he accepts graciously. However, you're just as apt to find him perched high on the back of the sofa, for he is an agile climber, light and graceful on his feet, much like a cat. This gentle yet merry breed insists on attention and interaction and is a terrific pet for senior citizens. At the other end of the spectrum, he is easily overwhelmed by small children and cannot take rough handling or mischief. Most Japanese Chin are polite with strangers, though a good many individuals are standoffish or timid, so socialization is important. This breed is peaceful with other pets. Though he has an aristocratic demeanor and definite likes and dislikes, the Japanese Chin is also bright, sensitive, and responsive. The little obedience training he needs will go well if you rely on consistency, praise, and food rewards. If you want a dog who... A Japanese Chin may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Japanese Chin may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

If you have small children, I do not recommend Japanese Chin puppies, no matter how well-meaning the child. Small children cannot help being clumsy, and that a child meant well is little solace to a Japanese Chin puppy who has been accidentally stepped on, sat on, rolled on, squeezed, or dropped onto the patio. Even Japanese Chin adults may feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making – and stress and shyness may be the result."
Keeshonds," Compared to other breeds in the ""spitz"" family, the Keeshond is quieter, more sensible, and less dominant. Bright, cheerful, and lively, the Keeshond needs moderate exercise, but more importantly, he needs companionship. He is very people-oriented, craves attention and petting, and needs to be fully involved in the family. Attitude toward strangers varies from friendly to polite. There is timidity in some lines, so early socialization is important to build an outgoing, confident temperament. With his acute hearing and emotional sensitivity, Keeshonds are more reactive to loud noises than some other breeds and don't do well in an environment with tension or shouting. This is not a guard dog. Keeshonds will bark, but it's usually welcoming rather than protective. Most are peaceful with other pets. The Keeshond has an independent streak and can be mischievous and ""clever"" (using his intelligence to get his own way). Focus on gentle, positive guidance and praise/food rewards. The Kees is known as the ""Smiling Dutchman"" because of his tendency to curl his lip and bare his teeth in a hideous grimace. It's not a snarl, but only a happy and submissive grin. If you want a dog who... A Keeshond may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Keeshond may not be right for you.

Kerry Blue Terriers," The Kerry Blue Terrier is extraordinarily bright and full of life. He has a high energy level, is always ready to play, and wants to be wherever you are. This sounds great, and it can be -- but it does have its downsides. You cannot leave a Kerry Blue Terrier alone all day, or stick him in the back yard and expect him to be passive and content. These intelligent dogs insist on being a full-fledged member of your family and cannot just be shunted aside. When bored or ignored, Kerries (like many other breeds, by the way) are likely to get into a world of mischief. Other important-to-know characteristics of the Kerry Blue Terrier are his pride, his sensitivity, a tendency toward moodiness, and his strong sense of justice. Taken together, this means the Kerry Blue doesn't meekly accept teasing, unfairness, or rough handling. That kind of sensitivity means that when you're training him, you can't push him too far. And yet, if you don't demonstrate firm, consistent leadership, a Kerry Blue Terrier will walk over you. The Kerry may be one of the smartest breeds in dogdom, but that definitely doesn't mean instant obedience. Unless you establish yourself as in charge, a Kerry can be headstrong, taking clever advantage of those who indulge him. With this complex temperament, this is not a good breed for a first-time or casual owner. Toward strangers, the Kerry Blue Terrier may be friendly or reserved, and even the friendly ones are sensibly protective. Some lines and individuals are more wary, and some are overprotective. Socialization is imperative to develop a stable attitude. A Kerry Blue Terrier is not always the best choice for multi-pet households. He may not go looking for a fight, but he certainly won't walk away from one, and he can have a high prey drive with cats, birds, and other small animals. If you want a dog who... A Kerry Blue Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Kerry Blue Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Kerry Blue Terrier If I was considering a Kerry Blue Terrier, I would be most concerned about...

Komondors," Although energetic and playful as a puppy, the Komondor matures into a serious, dignified, self-reliant adult at two or three years of age. Though calm and quiet indoors, he is emphatically not suited to an apartment. His ideal environment is a large home with a spacious and securely fenced yard, in the country without close neighbors. Komondors have a deep, impressive bark which they tend to use freely, especially at night when they are most attentive. Selflessly devoted to his family and distrustful of strangers, some Komondors are never completely comfortable with any outsider. Indeed, most Komondors must be carefully introduced to guests, then supervised while the guest is present in the home. Despite his bulk and heavy coat, the Komondor is remarkably agile and reacts very, very quickly. Early and ongoing socialization are essential if his territorial instincts are to remain controlled rather than indiscriminate. The Komondor is patient with his own family's children, but can be overprotective when neighborhood kids join in. Similarly, he may be protective of his own family's pets while aggressively attacking others. Livestock guardians were expected to keep watch and make their own decisions and that is exactly what the Komondor does. His instincts to trust his own judgment are very strong. Unless you establish yourself as the alpha (number one), no one will really have control over him. Frankly, most Komondors are ""too much dog"" for the average household. This is a serious working dog with tremendous strength, and very few people can really provide the home or lifestyle that keeps this breed satisfied. If you want a dog who... A Komondor may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Komondor may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Komondor If I was considering a Komondor, I would be most concerned about... For the easiest coat of all, you should trim or clip the coat so it's short and sanitary. I think a short clipped coat looks great! Once again, you can make things easiest for you and the dog by keeping his coat short. Hopefully you have come to the sensible conclusion that the Komondor is not suited to most households. Only specific living situations can provide the activities that keep him most satisfied."
Kuvasz," A cuddly white fluffball as a puppy, the Kuvasz matures into a bold, spirited dog, determined to protect those who are dear to him. This rugged breed deserves a roomy home with a spacious, securely fenced yard in the suburbs or country, for he feels compelled to announce every strange person and sound, and his deep bark may disturb the neighbors, especially at night when he is most vigilant. He is content with daily walks and regular opportunities to stretch out for a romp, but he does play hard and needs room to amble about and patrol his territory. Kuvasz are polite with accepted strangers, but rather suspicious and discriminating in making new friends. This breed needs early and ongoing socialization if his territorial instincts are to remain under control. With the children in his own family, Kuvasz are gentle and patient, but may become concerned and overprotective when neighborhood kids join in. Similarly, he may be amiable with the pets in his own family, yet think nothing of eradicating trespassing animals. As a livestock guardian, it is part of this breed's genetic makeup to lead. You must establish yourself as the leader so that he will turn the decision-making over to you. This can be a difficult task for first-time dog owners or those with passive personalities who can't take charge. If you want a dog who... A Kuvasz may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Kuvasz may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Kuvasz If I was considering a Kuvasz, I would be most concerned about... I think it's pretty clear that the Kuvasz is not a breed for most households. Only certain living situations can provide the activities that keep him most satisfied."
Labrador Retrievers,"   Yellow Labradors can be any shade from reddish to pale yellow, even approaching white. Nearly every obedience class I've ever taught has included at least one Lab. That's not because the breed has a lot of behavior problems – they don't – but simply because it's the most popular breed in the United States. And rightfully so. The Labrador Retriever is one terrific family dog – that is, when given enough vigorous exercise (including daily fetching games, and swimming if possible). You can't just leave this breed in the back yard every day with one walk around the block. Too much confinement and not enough exercise can lead to rambunctiousness and destructive chewing. One of the best dogs for children of all ages, Labrador Retrievers are kindly, good-natured, and take most things in stride. Most Labs are friendly with everyone, though compared to Golden Retrievers, many Labs are just a bit more conservative with their affections. Also more independent – though quite biddable and responsive to obedience training, some Labs have a noticeable stubborn streak. Some have necks like bulls and barely notice tugs on the leash. You must control this breed's tendency to chew on objects and to mouth your hands – provide a box filled with toys that he can carry around in his mouth. The Labrador Retriever matures slowly, remaining a spirited teenager for several years. It sounds fun.... but does require patience and training to manage.   Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament  is less predictable than the inheritance of physical  traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training.

Usually they're 21-25 inches at the shoulder, with males typically in the higher half of that range, and females in the lower half. Weight can be as low as 55 pounds, but is usually 65-80 pounds. Unfortunately, the trend seems to be for heavier and heavier Labs, with a lot of individuals topping 90 pounds. I say unfortunately because heavier weight isn't good for their joints. This breed was supposed to be a medium-sized hunting retriever who could fit comfortably in a bird blind or a small boat.   Show type Labrador Retriever. Much stockier than field type Labs. Not officially. There's only the one breed. They come in several colors, yet they're all Labrador Retrievers. For hunting and field trials, though, black Labs are by far the most common color. In my obedience classes, yellow Labs are often the calmest and most mild-mannered. In contrast, the chocolate Labs I've worked with have all been very energetic. Of course, it might just be coincidence! But apart from color, you'll definitely see Labs who look quite different from other Labs. Different builds, different body shapes. In particular, Labrador Retrievers used primarily for hunting and field trials look very different from Labs you see at dog shows that emphasize conformation. Labrador hunting/field lines are more athletic, agile, and energetic. They have a narrower head, longer muzzle, lankier body, and a sleeker coat. Labs from show lines are heavier-boned and stockier, with a large blocky head and dense coat. Even within show lines there are variations, with British/English show lines having the shortest muzzle, shortest legs, and chunkiest build. To me, those dogs don't really look like the classic Labrador Retriever. But they do tend to be very sweet dogs with mellow temperaments that fit well into many families.   Many owners don't give this breed the exercise it deserves. These athletic, bouncy dogs need regular opportunities to vent their energy and do interesting things. Otherwise they will become bored, which they may express by becoming rambunctious and destructive. Labs also need mental stimulation, which means interesting activities that keep the mind stimulated: For example, a challenging dog sport (agility, rally obedience, musical freestyle, tracking, flyball, frisbee, field trials); interactive dog toys; a homemade obstacle course; fetch games and tricks. Some of these activities are included in my training book, Teach Your Dog 100 English Words.   Black Labrador Retriever. Black is the most common color. Yes, training most Labrador Retrievers is easy. They housebreak quickly and are usually willing to please. But this breed is strong and energetic, especially adolescents. Many Labradors between one and three years old are dropped off at animal shelters or rescue groups because of dog behavior problems such as pulling vigorously on the leash and jumping on people. Focus on teaching loose-leash walking, indoor calmness, and no jumping. All of these are taught in my puppy training book, Respect Training For Puppies. Or see my advice on → dog training   Yes, most Labs are happy to see everyone. They'll bark when someone comes to the door, but they're not protective. This is a friendly, trusting breed.   Most Labs are among the best possible dogs for children. However, remember my cautions about exuberance and jumping. Young Labs (up to two or three years old) romp and jump with vigor. That means things can go flying – including people. If your Lab has been allowed to jump on people, you should stop this behavior immediately. Jumping can injure people, and even when it doesn't, it puts a dog in a heightened state of arousal that isn't good for him. If you don't yet have your dog and your home includes toddlers or infirm adults, you might consider skipping the challenging puppy and adolescent stages. Look into adopting an adult Labrador Retriever from a rescue group. Adults have a more settled temperament and you can specifically look for a calm one.   Most Labs are fine with other dogs and cats, fine with livestock, and even fine with very small pets such as rabbits and ferrets. Of course introductions should be made properly. Don't just plunk a baby bunny onto the floor and let your full-grown Lab loose in the room. Even a friendly dog can make mincemeat of a small fragile creature simply by jumping on it.   Labrador Retriever puppies hardly shed at all.... but that won't last! For such a shorthaired dog, Labrador Retrievers shed more than you might think – on the high side of average (at least). The bulk of their shedding occurs twice a year, for three weeks in the spring as their thicker winter coat switches to a cooler summer coat, and three weeks in the fall as their summer coat switches over to a winter coat. But they also shed some all through the year. Labs need more brushing than some other shorthaired breeds because of the high shedding. If you don't diligently pull out the dead undercoat during regular grooming sessions, it will all fall out on your floors and furniture. On the plus side, obviously Labs need no trimming!   Yellow Labrador. Labrador Retrievers typically live 10-12 years. Many Labs do live to 12 or 13, but usually with chronic health issues such as arthritis. Unfortunately, an increasing number of beloved Labs are lost in middle age to inherited forms of cancer or heart disease. Common orthopedic diseases in Labradors include hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, and luxating patella (loose knee joints), each of which causes chronic pain and lameness and can require expensive surgery. Labs are very prone to rupturing the ligaments in their hind legs – expensive surgery again. And if one hind leg ruptures, the other is likely to follow at a later time. Another surgery. It's a good idea to have pet insurance when you own a Lab. A number of eye diseases cause blindness in Labrador Retrievers. The breed is at higher-than-average risk for an emergency gastrointestinal syndrome called bloat, which can kill a healthy dog within hours. A number of neurological/neuromuscular diseases, some of them deadly, affect Labrador Retrievers. One example of an odd neuromuscular disease is called exercise-induced collapse. As the name suggests, affected Labradors who have been vigorously exercising suddenly begin swaying, collapse, and require a rest before they can move again. Here is a complete list of health problems in Labrador Retrievers. See my advice on → keeping your dog healthy
(feeding, vaccinations, neutering, veterinarians, and more).   The three major colors of Labs are black, yellow, and chocolate. Officially, Labrador Retrievers come in black, yellow, and chocolate. They also come in silver (gray), but this color is frowned on by breed purists. You might have heard someone say they had a Golden Lab or a Fox Red Lab or a White Lab. These are just made-up names for yellow Labs whose shade of yellow happens to be golden or reddish or whitish. Whatever the shade, it's still just a yellow Lab. Chocolate also comes in shades: from light coffee to deep chocolate brown. Now, what about silver Labrador Retrievers? The official breed clubs, and breeders who show their dog in the conformation ring, state that silver is a disqualified color for showing purposes. In fact, most Labrador breeders insist that silver dogs aren't even purebred. Their position is that the silver gene infiltrated the Labrador's gene pool by crossbreeding Labs with Weimaraners. I think they're probably right. I think that one or more Weimaraner crosses probably did introduce the silver gene at some point. However, since genetic diversity is a good thing in living creatures, I don't view cross-breeding as an evil thing. So if there are some Weimaraner genes floating around in a silver Labrador, that wouldn't bother me. On the other hand, if I wanted a dog who could be counted on to look and act like a Lab, you're more likely to get that in a Lab who isn't silver, especially if the silver breeder is still using Weimaraners in his breeding program. And based on the appearance of some silver ""Labs"", there are breeders who are still crossing in Weimaraners. But almost certainly silver Labrador Retrievers are here to stay. Even though they can't be shown, the AKC still accepts them for registration. However, in a funny twist, those registration papers don't say silver. Remember, the AKC says that Labs can only be black, chocolate, or yellow. So they register silver Labs as Chocolate, because they consider silver to be a dilution of the chocolate gene. In other words, according to the AKC, your silver Lab is actually a chocolate Lab also has inherited dilution gene that washes the chocolate into a silvery gray. It doesn't end there. Some silver Labs aren't silvery gray, but dark charcoal gray. The AKC registers these dogs as Black, considering charcoal to be a dilution of Black.   Yellow, black, and chocolate Labrador Retriever puppies. Congratulations! I'll be happy to show you how to raise and train your new family member. I can help you with that, too. Labrador Retrievers are the most common breed in the United States, so they're very easy to find. The problem is finding one with the best chances of staying healthy through the years. First, you need to think about the different types of Labrador Retriever we talked about earlier. Field/hunting type or show type. You can buy a Labrador Retriever puppy from a show breeder who breeds Labradors to match a detailed standard of appearance for the dog show ring. Or you can buy one from a performance breeder who emphasizes an energetic temperament and strong working drives for hunting. Some breeders are a combination of show/performance. But how they prioritize those two goals can vary greatly. Or you can just hop onto Craigslist and buy a Labrador Retriever puppy from someone who ""just breeds pets"" or ""just had one litter."" But should you? Not unless the seller has done the proper health certifications on the puppy's parents. One huge difference between a responsible breeder and an irresponsible ""puppy producer"" is – health certifications. BOTH PARENTS of a Labrador Retriever puppy should have: Also, at least ONE PARENT of a Labrador Retriever puppy should have: If a seller can't show you those certificates, the puppies are higher risk for health problems. You might choose to accept that risk. But then you need to be willing (and able) to pay a couple thousand bucks for future surgeries and lifelong meds if your Labrador Retriever ends up with cataracts and crippled joints. See my advice on → finding a good dog   Labrador Retrievers are often available from dog rescue groups. Labrador Retrievers may be turned over to Rescue because they shed too much or need more exercise than the owner was prepared to give. Or perhaps they pull on the leash or jump on people. You would need to provide these dogs with the exercise and training that they are lacking. Labrador Retrievers (more often, Lab crosses and mixes) are frequently found in animal shelters. However, shelter personnel can be overzealous in labeling every medium- to large shorthaired black dog as a ""Lab cross."" Dogs can look like Labs without having any Lab genes at all. Did you know there's a quick and simple DNA test that can tell you definitively which breeds make up any given dog?   The Golden Retriever is similar to a Labrador in being a great all-around family dog and a great choice for first-time owners. Compared to Labs, Goldens tend to be even more outgoing toward everyone and more eager to please. Goldens do shed more than Labs and have a greater risk of health issues. Compared to Labs and Goldens, the Flat-Coated Retriever needs more exercise and interesting activities to keep them busy. This is not a good breed for a casual or couch potato owner. Flat-Coats also suffer from serious health issues. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a great dog for experienced owners. Compared to the Lab, a Chessie has a stronger temperament, needs more exercise, is more reserved with strangers, and can be bossy toward strange dogs."
Lagotto Romagnolo,"   In a nutshell: lively, athletic, agile, fast, enthusiastic, smart, sensitive, quick learner, fond of water, fond of mud, fond of digging, loves to run and jump and swim and fetch. Wondering how to pronounce the breed's name? It's Lah-GO-toe Roman-YO-lo. Which refers to the ""water dog from the Romanga region of Italy."" The official plural is Lagotti Romagnoli, swapping the final o for an i, which is pronounced like a long e. Like so: Lah-GO-tee Roman-YO-lee. In the US, some breeders use the Italian plural, while others just say Lagottos with an s. To understand a breed's temperament and behavior, ask, ""What was he developed to do?"" Whichever traits help him accomplish his intended work have likely been ""hard-wired"" into his genes – not perfectly, not as reliably as programming a computer, but generally speaking. The Lagotto Romagnolo is a mid-sized (larger than small, smaller than medium) breed developed in medieval Italy as a water retriever. When the hunter shot down ducks over water, the Lagotto dove in and fetched the downed duck back to the hunter. So what sort of traits might you need in such a dog? Athleticism... endurance... toughness... willingness to follow directions... water-resistant, tightly-curled wooly coat to protect against the elements... When the marshlands were converted to farmland, the Lagotto Romagnolo found a new specialty in the Italian countryside: hunting truffles. Truffles are an edible fungus (similar to a mushroom) with an exquisite taste. Some people are so eager to consume this rare delicacy that they will pay hundreds, even thousands, of dollars for the privilege. There's even a black market industry for truffles. Often called the diamonds of the culinary word, truffles are considered (ounce for ounce) the most expensive food in the world. Because truffles grow underground and cannot be seen ripening, they are best found by detecting the strong aroma of the mature truffle. This is where the Lagotto comes in, with its great nose and keen work ethic. Growers plant truffle orchards and use their Lagotto to sniff out the first sign of maturing truffles. What traits might you expect from successful truffle hunters? Boundless energy, a keen desire to search, persistence, determination, and an exquisite sense of smell. Lagottos have also been trained as Service Dogs able to detect medical conditions such as an imminent seizure or a dangerous blood-sugar drop. In Search & Rescue, Lagottos use their powerful nose to find people trapped under rubble after natural disasters. So looking at the work a breed was designed for, or is currently being used for, gives us a realistic idea of what that breed is going to be like. I hope you won't make the mistake of acquiring a Lagotto because you think it's a convenient size for your apartment or because it looks cute and cuddly. The Lagotto has been bred for working purposes since the 1400s. For centuries, in other words. These dogs have a lot of energy and they need a purpose in their lives. For example, the Italian Lagotto Club offers truffle-finding (working aptitude) tests throughout Italy. In the US, a variety of stimulating activities can satisfy the Lagotto's craving for something challenging to do. But don't get the impression that the breed runs wildly around your house all day and needs to be doing something every single hour. No. But you do need to commit to vigorous exercise and mental stimulation several times a day, even for just 30 minutes at a time. Then the Lagotto will be happy to chill with you in front of the TV the rest of the time. This affectionate dog craves ongoing companionship with his family.   Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament  is less predictable than the inheritance of physical  traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. ""Respect Training for Puppies""  (or ""Respect Training for Adult Dogs"" ) is a step by step guide to help you bring out the best in your pup so you can enjoy a calm and well-behaved dog, no matter what his age.

A healthy dog is a happy dog, so buy your copy today.     Prospective owners who have never seen a Lagotto up-close often think the breed is smaller than it actually is. This is probably because breeders and breed clubs describe it as ""small to medium"", which makes some people think the breed comes in a variety of sizes from small to medium, so they can get a ""small"" one if they want. Reality check... the Lagotto is not a small breed. Nor is it a medium breed, which would be more like a Border Collie or Springer Spaniel. The Lagotto Romagnolo is a mid-sized breed: So the Lagotto is about the same weight as a Cocker Spaniel... but the Lagotto stands several inches taller. His build should be square and robust. What it shouldn't be is elegant or fragile. The AKC Standard says, ""The dog should give the impression that he has the strength and endurance to work all day in difficult and challenging terrain.""    More than you might think! It's always a concern to me when a casual pet owner gets a breed with a sporting/working ancestry. He often doesn't realize that these breeds require an active lifestyle if you expect their behavior to be calm and content. In the case of the Lagotto, he doesn't need miles/hours of running exercise. But he definitely wants and needs a decent-sized fenced yard AND frequent  sessions of vigorous physical activity (not just walks on a leash) plus challenging mental stimulation. After which a Lagotto will happily snooze in his dog bed. Mental stimulation means an activity that keeps the dog's intelligent mind occupied – some sort of puzzle to solve. Even owners who diligently provide enough physical exercise often fail to provide the mental aspect. And what happens if you don't provide a sufficiently active lifestyle? Then your Lagotto, with his needs not met, will vent his frustrations via barking, jumping, chewing, and hyperactivity. What kinds of physical exercise and mental stimulation should you provide a Lagotto? You probably don't have a lot of truffles in your neck of the woods, but you can substitute some fun nose work  activities for your would-be truffle hunter. Nose work means teaching your Lagotto how to alert you when he sniffs out a particular scent. Another excellent activity for these super-fast athletes is the sport of Agility, an obstacle course for canines. Also Rally obedience, frisbee, flyball, musical freestyle, complex trick routines.... all wonderful activities for a Lagotto. Finally, with their water dog ancestry, many Lagotti love water, love to retrieve, and love to run and jump. Combine those loves into one activity and you get... dock diving. Check it out! (Or just take your Lagotto swimming.) If you involve your Lagotto in multiple activities, he can win a Versatility Certificate from the Lagotto Romagnolo Club of America. Summary: Engage your Lagotto's superb athletic skills and high intelligence with physical and mental activities that channel his natural drive to work.   In general, a Lagotto whose needs are being met is usually pretty easy to train. Just use a light hand on the leash and establish the right Leader-Follower relationship and the dog will be happy to work with you. However, some Lagottos are more independent and will use their intelligence to figure out how to do things they want to do. These individuals are too clever/manipulative for a first-time owner. But most Lagottos learn quickly and respond beautifully to consistent leadership. This is taught in my puppy training book, Respect Training For Puppies (30 seconds to a calm, polite, well-behaved puppy). Or see my advice on → dog training   Some Lagotti are friendly and outgoing with everyone. But most are a little reserved until they get to know you. There is shyness/fearfulness in some lines, so if you want an outgoing, confident Lagotto, make sure both of your pup's parents (preferably grandparents, too) are outgoing and confident. Yes! Whether a Lagotto is friendly or reserved toward strangers, he has sharp ears, sharp eyes, and a sharp nose and so makes a reliable alarm dog. Not a guard dog, mind you! Just a dog who sounds the alarm. In fact, some Lagottos are too  enthusiastic about sounding the alarm. They must be taught that a few barks are fine, but then the dog must be quiet and let you take over. This is up to the owner to teach.   If the dog has a confident temperament and has been raised around children... and if said children are well-behaved, things should go well. However, some Lagottos are very sensitive and may feel stressed around small children who run, scream, wave their hands around, etc. Also be aware that young Lagottos can be rowdy. Until you teach them that jumping is not allowed, they could easily cause a young toddler (or an infirm adult) to fall over.   Most Lagotti are fine with other dogs and cats. Unlike most other hunting breeds, most of which have strong instincts to pursue small animals, the Lagotto has been designed to have reduced  chasing instincts so the dog wouldn't get distracted by, say, a passing rabbit when on the ""hunt"" for truffles.    Technically they don't shed much but that's largely because their shed hairs get caught in the curly coat instead of falling out onto your floor or furniture or clothing. Some people who are allergic to dog hair or dander can live comfortably with a Lagotto. Some people. I really don't recommend this breed if a family member is allergic to dog hair. As far as grooming goes, the time and effort required is moderate to significant. You can see the breed's water dog ancestry in the rustic coat: a thick mass of wooly-textured, tightly-ringed curls atop a dense undercoat. The water-resistant curls feel semi-rough, even harsh to the touch. A Lagotto puppy's coat does feel soft and is often wavy rather than curly. The correct coarseness and curl will develop over the first 2-3 years. From a practical perspective, the wooly curls pick up burrs, thorns, leaves, mud.... On an ongoing basis you'll need to remove this debris. You also need to brush the curls as necessary to keep them from fusing together into felted mats, which would otherwise create dark, moist hiding places for parasites, bacteria, and fungi. The Lagotto's curly hair keeps on growing, so requires regular trimming and clipping. I recommend clipping every 6-8 weeks to keep the curls short, no more than an inch (measured with the coat curled, not brushed out straight). The longer the curls are allowed to grow, the easier it is for them to twist together into a tangled mess.  Very rarely, a Lagotto will be born with a shorthaired coat rather than curly. This is not a health issue, just a trait that breeders and breed clubs don't like. Obviously a shorthaired coat is much easier to maintain, but it does shed more because the shed hairs obviously don't get caught in the curls any more.   The typical lifespan of a Lagotto is 11-14 years. Overall, their health is good, but they are vulnerable to a few serious health issues. About 1 of every 4 Lagottos has hip dysplasia, a malformation of the hip joint that causes pain and lameness and leads to chronic arthritis. The Lagotto can suffer from two different forms of epilepsy. One form appears in young Lagotto Romagnolo puppies and (thankfully) goes away in just a few months... usually, not always. The other form of epilepsy appears in Lagotto adults and requires lifelong medication. Along with epilepsy, three more neurological diseases (all inherited, all severe) occur in the Lagotto. All of these diseases cause tremors, loss of balance, uncoordinated movements, and tripping/falls. Here is my complete list of health problems in Lagotto Romagnolo. See my advice on → keeping your dog healthy
(feeding, vaccinations, neutering, veterinarians, and more).   Tan markings are also allowed, but only in the same positions you would see them on a Doberman or Rottweiler: above the eyes, on the cheeks, under the muzzle, on the chest and lower legs, and under the tail. To avoid disappointment, prospective buyers should understand how colors work on Lagottos – namely, the color usually FADES as the dog matures. For example, a young puppy might be chocolate brown or golden orange, but as he matures, the rich color fades to a more diluted shade of beige, buff, or cream. (The dog's head, however, often remains a darker shade than the rest of the coat.) Owners who are unprepared might find themselves unhappy with the diluted color. But you might get lucky.... occasionally a dark brown puppy will maintain his dark shade into adulthood.    Congratulations! I'll be happy to show you how to raise and train your new family member. I can help you with that, too. The best source of a Lagotto puppy is a breeder whose goal is sound structure, temperament, and health (rather than simply winning ribbons in the show ring). Or you can hop onto Craigslist and buy a Lagotto puppy from someone who ""just breeds pets"" or ""just had one litter."" But should you? Not unless the seller has done the proper health certifications on the puppy's parents. One huge difference between a responsible breeder and an irresponsible ""puppy producer"" is – health certifications. BOTH PARENTS of a Lagotto Romagnolo puppy should have: Also, at least ONE PARENT of a Lagotto Romagnolo puppy should have a DNA test proving they are Normal/Clear of FOUR Lagotto diseases: If a seller can't show you those certificates, the puppies are at much higher risk for health problems. See my advice on → finding  a good dog   You'll have to get really, really lucky. Lagottos are seldom available from shelters or rescue groups. Oh, you might see a mid-sized curly-haired dog at a shelter, but it's almost certainly not a Lagotto; the breed just isn't common enough, at least in the United States. Dogs can look like a Lagotto without having any Lagotto Romagnolo genes at all. Did you know there's a quick and simple DNA test that can tell you definitively which breeds make up any given dog? So if it's an adult Lagotto you're interested in, your best source is a breeder. They will sometimes offer a retired brood bitch or retired stud dog to a good pet home. Or one of their own puppies may have been returned to them, now all grown up and needing a new home. However... your question must be: Why was this dog returned? Behavior issues? You need to find out before you unknowingly adopt a problem.   Depending on how he's trimmed, a curly-haired Portuguese Water Dog can look like a Lagotto. Both breeds are athletic nature-lovers who enjoy playing in water and mud. Compared to a Lagotto, the Portuguese Water Dog is larger and stronger-willed. Again depending on trimming style, a Miniature Poodle can resemble a Lagotto. Both breeds are lively, athletic, sensitive, and very bright. Compared to a Lagotto, a Miniature Poodle is a bit smaller, needs less exercise, and is easier to train. If you prefer something a bit larger than a Lagotto, there's an ""unofficial"" Poodle size called moyen, meaning middle, which is in-between a Miniature Poodle and a Standard Poodle."
Lakeland Terriers," The AKC Standard describes the Lakeland Terrier as ""bold, gay and friendly, with a confident, cock-of-the-walk attitude."" Though not as boisterous or argumentative as some terriers, the workmanlike Lakeland is still animated and intense. Always alert and ready to go, he has strong working instincts and loves to exercise outdoors. Unfortunately, his curiosity and tenacity can get him into tight spots (literally) unless your fences are secure and he is well supervised. The Lakeland Terrier does best with active owners who are confident and consistent, for he has a marked independent streak and will take advantage if indulged. Lakelands are better with other dogs than some other terriers. But they won't back down if challenged. Little creatures that run, including your child's pet hamster, will quickly come to an untimely end. When well socialized, the Lakeland Terrier is polite with strangers. Yet he can be counted on to sound the alert when anything is amiss. As with most terriers, excessive barking may need to be controlled. Lakeland Terriers love to tunnel and dig and can be possessive of their food and toys. If you want a dog who... A Lakeland Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Lakeland Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Lakeland Terrier If I was considering a Lakeland Terrier, I would be most concerned about... I do not recommend terriers for small children. Many terriers will not tolerate any nonsense from little life forms whom they consider to be below themselves in importance. Many terriers are quick to react to teasing, and even to the normal clumsiness that comes with small children (accidental squeezing of their ears or pulling of whiskers or stepping on their paw). Many terriers are possessive of their food and toys and will defend these from all comers, including children."
Leonbergers," Noble and powerful, a good Leonberger is calm and steady, yet bolder and more athletic than most giant breeds. The Leonberger enjoys swimming, tracking, agility, therapy work, pulling a cart or sled, and weight pulling -- all productive outlets for his energy. Fetching a ball or Frisbee, however, is not a natural activity for this breed. The Leonberger is a loving, steadfast dog who thrives on being made an integral part of the family. Though protective instincts develop at maturity (three to four years) and he becomes more discriminating with strangers, he should never be aggressive. His deep, imposing bark and confident presence should be enough to deter intruders. This stability, however, assumes early and ongoing socialization and a sound-tempered bloodline. Some Leonbergers are unfortunately shy and/or sharp. Dog aggression can be a problem, and two Leonbergers of the same sex should not be kept together. Obedience training should start at three months old. Heeling is imperative, because these powerful dogs can literally pull you off your feet. His determination to jump up into your face and lean against your leg (leading to the affectionate nickname ""Lean-on-berger"") can be disconcerting. During adolescence, his hormones will kick in and he might start to test his owner, who must respond with consistent leadership and more training. This is especially true of Leonberger males. Leos can be messy: Their huge paws track in mud; they may drool if stressed; and most play in their water bowls, dunking their heads and coming up slobbering. It is said that their natural look is slightly damp with leaves stuck to their coats. If you want a dog who... A Leonberger may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Leonberger may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Leonberger If I was considering a Leonberger, I would be most concerned about... Since you need to minimize their exercise, young Leonbergers can be very rambunctious. They will romp with uncoordinated gawkiness all over your house. You need to substitute extra quantities of companionship and supervision. Otherwise, left alone, young Leonbergers become bored and destructive. To teach your Leonberger to listen to you, ""Respect Training"" is mandatory. Read more about Leonberger Training."
Lhasa Apsos," Too many people buy a Lhasa Apso puppy based on his brash and comical antics, envisioning a cuddly lapdog. In truth, the adult Lhasa Apso is one of the hardiest, toughest, and strongest-willed of all the small breeds. It is said that ""when a Lhasa Apso looks in the mirror, he sees a lion."" Though he can certainly be playful, the adult Lhasa carries himself with regal dignity. Rather calm and deliberate in nature, he makes a mannerly house dog IF you can establish a relationship of mutual respect – i.e., admiring his independent character while consistently enforcing your rules so that he respects you as well. The AKC Standard calls the Lhasa Apso ""chary with strangers."" Chary means cautious or wary, and indeed he is. With his acute senses, keen observation skills, and distrust of anything new or different, Lhasas take their watchdog responsibilities seriously. Unfortunately some individuals are not just ""all bark"" and may be very willing to bite if pushed. Lhasa Apsos need early socialization with people to ensure that they don't become too sharp. With other animals, the Lhasa can be bossy and jealous Yet despite squabbles, most Lhasas do live more or less peacefully with other family pets. Very smart, but also dominant and manipulative, the Lhasa Apso can be a challenge to train. They cannot be forced to do anything, nor will they meekly accept harshness or teasing. Training methods that emphasize food and praise will be met with much more cooperation. If you want a dog who... A Lhasa Apso may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Lhasa Apso may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dogs," One breeder says, ""The Catahoula will not let you forget that you own a dog."" The Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog, often called ""King of the Stock Dogs,"" belongs on a farm or ranch. He is a serious working dog who goes about his business with tremendous focus and assertiveness. This athletic, rugged dog requires at least an hour of running exercise each day. Without sufficient outlets for his high energy, he will become rambunctious and destructive. Most Catahoula Leopard Dogs are reserved with strangers and naturally protective. Skittishness and sharpness can be problems in some lines, so you need to be careful about where you get your dog. Then you need to socialize extensively, right from puppyhood. The Catahoula can be dominant and pushy with other animals, especially with other dogs of the same sex. He may or may not cohabit well in multi-pet homes. Catahoulas can be possessive of their food and belongings. This is not a good breed for a novice owner. Catahoula Leopard Dogs are independent and like to be in charge. You must be a confident leader or they will walk all over you. Overall, this is a capable, versatile companion when allowed to fulfill his working heritage. Otherwise, he may not be happy and can be too much dog to handle. If you want a dog who... A Louisiana Catahoula Leopard Dog may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with...

Lowchen," The bright, happy little Lowchen is a moderate breed in all respects. He will romp playfully in the yard, trot gracefully beside you during walks (on-leash), then curl up in your lap to sleep. Very people-oriented, the Lowchen (also called the ""Little Lion Dog"") needs a lot of attention and interaction and doesn't like to be left alone for long periods of time. This is not a dog for people who work all day. He is peaceful and gentle with everyone (humans and animals alike), though he is also very inquisitive and likes to sit perched on the back of a sofa or chair, looking out the window so he can announce visitors. Although he might announce non-visitors, too! In other words, barking may need to be controlled. As with most sweet-natured breeds, there is timidity in some lines. Early socialization is important to build an outgoing, confident temperament. Attentive and responsive to nonforceful obedience training, many Lowchens do well in competitive obedience and agility. The only training area where they can be a bit slow is housebreaking. If you want a dog who... A Lowchen may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Lowchen may not be right for you.

To housebreak a Lowchen, consistent crate training is mandatory. Or a doggy door will allow access to a small enclosed ""potty yard"" whenever the dog needs to go."
Maltese,"  Maltese are great! On the Mediterranean island of Malta, the Maltese was developed to be the household pet of wealthy, cultured families. One of the brightest, sweetest, and gentlest of the toys, the Maltese is exceedingly playful and enjoys games of cleverness and dexterity such as ""pull the hidden toy from under the cabinet with your paw.... then push it back under again!"" This curious, quick-moving sprite doesn't need much outdoor exercise, but he does enjoy dashing around your (fenced!) yard and accompanying you for walks. Larger dogs may view him as a delicacy, so a Maltese must always be leashed or fenced for his own protection. Fences should be triple-checked for slight gaps, which would be fine for larger dogs, but through which a Maltese might wriggle. Maltese are generally peaceful with the world, meaning they are not naturally dominant or aggressive. Some are more confident and friendly, others are more cautious or standoffish. The general temperament of your Maltese depends to some extent upon genetics – outgoing parents tend to produce outgoing youngsters. But along with the genes he inherited, how you raise your Maltese will also play a large factor in how he turns out. As a behavioral consultant, when I'm seeing a ""problem"" Maltese, almost invariably the dog has been spoiled (over-indulged). His owner (1) has not taught the dog commands; (2) laughs at naughty behavior; (3) makes excuses for bad behavior; and (4) cuddles and ""soothes"" and ""coos"" over the dog too much. Far too much. Your Maltese is much more likely to end up anxious and insecure (or bratty and yappy) if you treat him like an infant or a stuffed toy.  Spoiling is a dreadful way to raise a dog; all it does is make the owner feel good, while creating an insecure dog who barks manically whenever he sees something that looks or sounds unfamiliar. What an awful state of mind for that dog to live with. All dogs, whatever their size, should be taught how to walk on their own four feet, how to do what they're told, and how to get along peacefully with the world. This creates a confident, stable Maltese. Now, you do need to take precautions! There are indeed dangers lurking everywhere for toy dogs. The trick is to let your Maltese walk on his own as much as possible, while still keeping an eagle eye out for real danger. If you don't protect his safety, he can be hurt or killed, but if you baby him and don't require him to be well-behaved, he can end up insecure or downright nasty The good news is that Maltese are very sensitive and responsive to training. In fact, a good number of Maltese excel in competitive obedience and agility. The bad news is.... Unfortunately the same cannot be said of house training. The vast majority of Maltese do not excel at housebreaking. Yes, sad to say, this fun-loving little breed is notoriously difficult to housebreak. Consider an indoor litterbox, or a doggy door leading outside to a small covered potty yard. Finally, Maltese are prone to separation anxiety when left home too long by themselves. More than most other breeds, Maltese need a great deal of companionship and do not like being left alone for more than a few hours. They tend to express their anxiety and unhappiness through destructive chewing and barking.   Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament  is less predictable than the inheritance of physical  traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training.

According to the official breed clubs, Maltese are ""supposed"" to stand about 7-8 inches at the shoulder and weigh 4-7 lbs. But many individuals are smaller than 4 lbs (not good for overall health) and many individuals are larger than 7 lbs (safer, sturdier family pets). You might have heard those phrases associated with Maltese. For example, a breeder might tell you that ""Toy"" Maltese are a certain weight range, ""Tiny Toy"" Maltese are slightly smaller, ""Extreme Tiny"" Chihuahuas are smaller than that, etc. These breeders might even price their dogs according to weight, as if that should define a dog's value. And their prices are typically ridiculous. Theses phrases are made-up marketing fluff, coined by savvy breeders who know that these cutesy phrases attract (gullible) buyers. Most of these breeders are irresponsible and their prices are typically ridiculous. There is only one Maltese breed. There are no weight classes. Whether an individual weighs 2 pounds or 6 pounds or 10 pounds, he's still just a Maltese. Some individuals are simply smaller or larger than others. Unfortunately, Maltese under 4 pounds are higher risks when it comes to health. Their bones are fragile. There is not enough room in their mouth for healthy teeth. Their internal organs are often weak and can fail suddenly. They tend to have difficulty regulating their blood sugar and can suddenly fall into hypoglycemic (low blood sugar) comas that can be fatal. Responsible Maltese breeders never try to produce these tiny high-risk creatures. If a tiny one pops up in one of their litters, they do their best to find the best home that can keep it alive, yes, but they try hard not to produce them in the first place. IRRESONSIBLE breeders, on the other hand, deliberately breed tiny, high-risk Maltese, because they can sell them for high prices to unsuspecting owners. If you reward irresponsible breeders by giving them your money, you are encouraging them to keep producing tiny, sickly, short-lived creatures. Please be a responsible buyer and stick with Maltese who will mature at 4 pounds and up, who have the best chance of living a normal healthy life. In this way, breeders will be motivated to produce these sizes. You can estimate whether a puppy will mature at 4 pounds and up by this guideline: if he already weighs at least 2 pounds at 10-12 weeks old, he should mature at over 4 pounds. It's not a perfect guideline, but it's usually close. Look at the puppy's mother and father. If they're well over 4 pounds, their puppies are more likely to be, as well.   Maltese are great! Not much outdoor exercise, but that's because they're so lively indoors and get most of their exercise running around the house. So if you have an apartment or condo with no fenced yard, is a Maltese a good choice? You might be wondering if it would be okay to let your Maltese off-leash in that nicy grassy area beside your driveway. I would never do that – there are far too many dangers lurking for a dog of this size. Along with physical exercise, your Maltese will appreciatemental exercise, where the dog gets to participate in interesting activities that keep his mind stimulated. This might be a dog sport such as agility, rally obedience, or musical freestyle. It might be interactive dog toys, or a homemade obstacle course, or learning tricks, or playing games such as Hide 'n Seek. Some of these activities are included in my training book, Teach Your Dog 100 English Words.   Maltese are great! Ah, that depends on what you want to teach them! If you live in a cold or rainy climate, housebreaking will be especially difficult, because Maltese hate cold and wet. All of these housebreaking options are detailed in my puppy training book, Respect Training For Puppies. Or see my advice on → dog training   Some Maltese are extremely friendly, while others are more standoffish. Either type will bark when someone comes to the door. Your job is to teach your Maltese that some initial barking is fine... but that the dog must stop barking when you take over and go to open the door. This will only happen when your dog views himself as the follower and you as the leader. This is covered in my dog training books.   I never recommend keeping a Maltese with children under the age of about 9, no matter how well-meaning the child. Younger children cannot help being clumsy, and that a child ""meant well"" is little solace to a Maltese who has been accidentally stepped on, sat on, squeezed, hit with an errant ball, or dropped down the stairs or onto the concrete patio. In addition, most Maltese feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making, and stress and fearfulness (even defensive biting) may be the result.   Maltese are great! Maltese are generally peaceful and get along great with other pets in their own family. But you should be careful about mixing them with larger dogs. If you want to try this, be sure you can read dogs accurately, and be sure the other dog is quiet, gentle, and well behaved. A big bouncy dog can hurt a Maltese by accident. I would not mix a Maltese with a breed whose heritage is chasing prey animals. Maltese can look like prey animals, especially when they move quickly. This can trigger instinctive chasing behavior in breeds such as medium to large terriers, sighthounds, herding breeds, and northern (spitz) breeds like Alaskan Malamutes and Akitas. With other dogs outside their own family, a Maltese might be friendly or not. Many toy breeds tend to pitch a fit when they spy a strange dog, especially a larger dog. Most likely they're blustering, trying to convince the larger dog that he needs to ""move along"" rather than having the toy dog for lunch. This is an anxious state of mind for your little dog to live with. Better to teach him that you are the leader who will take charge of keeping other dogs away from him. Then he will be able to relax and leave everything up to you. That's the psychologically healthy and secure mind-set you want your dog to have.   Maltese are great! Maltese shed very little, but coat care is a major consideration with this breed. Without frequent brushing and combing and trimming, a Maltese becomes a matted mess. The worst places for mats and tangles are behind the ears, in the armpits behind the front legs and the body, and on the chest, stomach, and groin. The legs and paws also need to be kept combed free of mats and tangles. In addition, you should regularly clip around the dog's groin and anal area so they remain clean and sanitary when your little longhaired dog goes to the bathroom. Remember, anything that sticks to long hair (including waste!) eventually ends up on your furnishings. Honestly, I recommend keeping a Maltese coat clipped short. You can do this yourself, or have a professional groomer do it. A sheared coat is more comfortable for the dog, it's always clean and sanitary, and it's so easy to brush and bathe. And it makes your Maltese look like an adorable puppy throughout his life! Maltese are great! The only potential negative to a clipped coat is that some of the shed hair can more easily fall onto your floor and furniture. Whereas with the coat left long, the shed hairs get trapped by the long coat and only come out on your brush. Either way, though, Maltese produce very little dander and are one of the few breeds tolerated by many allergy sufferers.   Maltese are great! Maltese typically live 12-15 years. But whether they actually make it to that age depends largely on YOU. Like many toy breeds, Maltese are more prone to injury than to illness or disease. So whether a Maltese lives a long healthy life, or not, depends to a great extent on how careful you are to keep them safe. Remember, a tiny creature can be seriously injured or killed by something that a bigger dog would barely feel. Children should not pick up this breed. If an older child is trustworthy and your Maltese is calm and wearing a harness and leash, you can place her in the child's arms, but keep the leash short and under control. It's safer if children sit on the ground to hold and play with a Maltese. Owning a toy breed means constant supervision and surveillance of what's going on around your tiny dog. Outside of their own fenced yard, Maltese should always be kept under leash or arm control. Too much can happen to these little guys in the blink of an eye. Here is my complete list of health problems in Maltese. See my advice on → keeping your dog healthy
(feeding, vaccinations, neutering, veterinarians, and more).   A Maltese is always solid white, or white with light tan or lemon shadings on his ears. If you see someone advertising a ""Maltese"" as black or brown or any other non-white color, it's a crossbred Maltese, not a purebred Maltese. A crossbred means one of the pup's parents was a Maltese but the other parent was a different breed (one that comes in non-white).   Maltese are great! Congratulations! I'll be happy to show you how to raise and train your new family member. I can help you with that, too. Maltese are very common and easy to find. But first, are you really sure you want one? Are you sure you can provide what this breed needs? Insert relevant sections from buying page Or you can just hop onto Craigslist and buy a Maltese puppy from someone who ""just breeds pets"" or ""just had one litter."" But should you? Not unless the seller has done the proper health certifications on the puppy's parents. One huge difference between a responsible breeder and an irresponsible ""puppy producer"" is – health certifications. BOTH PARENTS of a Maltese puppy should have: If a seller can't show you those certificates, the puppies are higher risk for health problems. You might choose to accept that risk. But then you need to be willing (and able) to pay a couple thousand bucks for future surgeries and lifelong meds if your Maltese ends up with glaucoma or crippled joints. See my advice on → finding  a good dog   Adopting From Dog Rescue Organizations
Maltese (and Maltese crosses and mixes) are frequently available from Dog Rescue groups. Maltese may be turned over to Rescue because their elderly owner died, or due to their significant grooming needs or housebreaking problems or barking or ""separation anxiety"" when left alone. Maltese are great! Adopting From Public Animal Shelters and Humane Societies
Maltese might sometimes be found here, although shelter personnel can be overzealous in labeling every small white longhaired dog as a ""Maltese cross."" Be aware that dogs can look like Maltese without having any Maltese genes at all. Did you know there's a quick and simple DNA test that can tell you definitively which breeds make up any given dog?   The Maltese actually belongs to a ""family"" of related breeds. These kissing cousins are all similar in appearance and overall temperament. They all need considerable coat care. They don't shed much. They make lively, playful companions. Unfortunately, they all tend to be slow to housebreak. Bichon Frise (bee-shon free-ZAY) Havanese Coton de Tulear (Ca-TONE duh TOO-lee-arr) Bolognese (bo-lo-NEES) LOWCHEN (the LOW is pronounced as in allow) The Yorkshire Terrier doesn't belong to the same family of breeds. But if you want a very small and light-shedding breed with more spunk than the breeds above, Yorkies are a nice blend of terrier and toy traits. You can clip the coat short for easy maintenance. Sadly though.... still very hard to housebreak!"
Manchester Terriers," The Manchester Terrier comes in Standard and Toy varieties, which are considered separate breeds. Both sizes have the same sleek coat and black-and-tan color pattern. Both sizes have a similar build – slender and elegant. But the Standard Manchester is larger and sturdier, while the Toy Manchester is more fragile. This lively, agile breed is best suited to active families, as he enjoys brisk walking every day and all-out running whenever he can get it. Keep him on-leash or in a securely fenced area, for he is very curious, has strong hunting instincts, and will chase anything. Manchester Terriers love to play – with you, with another dog, or with a toy by themselves. Devoted to his owner and wary with strangers, the Manchester Terrier is an excellent watchdog. In fact, he can be prone to excessive ""watching"" accompanied by excessive barking. Also, early socialization is imperative so that he doesn't become either sharp or skittish with strangers. With other dogs, Manchester Terriers will stand their ground and will fight when challenged, or when they feel their space has been invaded. Two adults of the same sex should not be kept together. Smaller creatures, including low-flying birds, will be pursued with determination. The Manchester Terrier is smart and trainable if you are a confident, consistent leader who can smile at his antics, yet not allow him to outwit you. This breed is sensitive to physical corrections, so use a light hand on the leash and rely more on praise and food rewards. But food in moderation, please, as he tends to pack on pounds quickly! Toy Manchesters, more than the Standards, are comfort-loving dogs who seek out soft beds and often tunnel under the covers. If you want a dog who... A Standard or Toy Manchester Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Standard or Toy Manchester Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Manchester Terrier If I was considering a Manchester Terrier, I would be most concerned about... Outdoor activities with your Manchester Terrier should be done in a safe enclosed area. Like all terriers, the Manchester is prone to taking off after anything that runs. For their own safety, terriers should not be trusted off-leash. Note that I do not recommend terriers for homes with small children. Many terriers will not tolerate any nonsense from little life forms whom they consider to be below themselves in importance. Many terriers are quick to react to teasing, and even to the normal clumsiness that comes with small children (accidental squeezing of their ears or stepping on their paw). Many terriers are possessive of their food and toys and will defend these from all comers, including children."
Old English Mastiffs," The AKC Standard says, ""A combination of grandeur and good nature, courage and docility. Dignity, rather than gaiety, is the Mastiff's correct demeanor."" I use the name Old English Mastiff  to distinguish this breed from all the other Mastiffs: the French Mastiff (Dogue de Bordeaux), Italian Mastiff (Cane Corso), Argentine Mastiff (Dogo Argentino), Brazilian Mastiff (Fila Brasileiro), Neapolitan Mastiff, Tibetan Mastiff, Bullmastiff, and others. The Old English Mastiff is calm and quiet (as an adult!) but he belongs in a roomy home with a spacious fenced yard, so that his massive body has stretching room. To stay fit, he needs daily walks (whether he seems to want them or not), but he isn't a jogging partner. Mastiffs also need companionship – lots of it every day. This is not a breed to leave alone for many hours. Most English Mastiffs are polite with everyone, but there is timidity (even extreme shyness) in some lines, and aggression in others. To ensure a stable temperament, English Mastiffs need earlier and more frequent socialization than many other breeds. This socialization should continue throughout their life. Watchfulness should be discouraged, as it's best for all concerned if a Mastiff intimidates by his presence alone, rather than by his behavior. Some Old English Mastiffs are peaceful with other animals, while others are dominant (even combative) with dogs of the same sex. Though mildly stubborn, this good-natured dog responds well to patient, consistent leadership. Mastiffs tend to be ""gassy"" dogs, which bothers some people. They also snore, drool, and slobber – big time! Obviously this is not the breed for people who need a tidy household. If you want a dog who... An Old English Mastiff may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Old English Mastiff may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Old English Mastiff If I was considering an English Mastiff, I would be most concerned about... Without careful socialization, a Mastiff may be suspicious of everyone. This can lead to either aggression or shyness, and both attitudes are dangerous in a giant breed. Fearful Mastiffs can bite defensively if they feel cornered. And it's no fun trying to drag a huge frightened dog along by the leash in public. To teach your Old English Mastiff to listen to you, ""Respect Training"" is mandatory. Read more about Old English Mastiff Training. The truth is that the Old English Mastiff is probably ""too much dog"" for the average household."
Miniature Pinschers," The AKC Standard says that characteristic traits of the Miniature Pinscher are ""fearless animation, complete self-possession, and spirited presence."" This sleek, elegant breed with the quick, prancing gait is perhaps the ""busiest"" and most intense of the toy breeds. Assertive and proud, athletic and agile, the Miniature Pinscher is convinced that he's a big dog. He seems to be in perpetual motion and enjoys brisk, vigorous, interactive games. He also demands cuddling, but you should be careful not to obey HIS commands – in other words, begin and end cuddling on YOUR terms. Otherwise, his demanding behaviors will get worse and worse. MinPins love comfort, especially snuggling under blankets. Outdoors, he must be kept on-leash or in a securely fenced area at all times, for he is sharp-eyed, curious, and extremely quick to react. Unless exceptionally well-trained, Min Pins don't come back when you call them. Often they don't stay where you leave them, either – they are incredible climbers and clever escape artists. Keenly observant and territorial, the Miniature Pinscher takes his watchdog role seriously. He will show strangers his backside accompanied by vocal threats and defiant kicking of the ground with his rear feet. Early and frequent socialization is required so that your Min Pin doesn't become sharp or shrill. Miniature Pinschers can be dominant with other dogs, especially larger ones. Smaller creatures such as rodents and birds will be pursued with determination. In the right hands, this bright breed is very trainable. But he has a mind of his own and can be headstrong and demanding. Miniature Pinschers are tough on toys and will rip squeakers and stuffed animals to shreds. They love to bark, and housebreaking can be difficult. If you want a dog who... A Miniature Pinscher may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Miniature Pinscher may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Miniature Pinscher If I was considering a Miniature Pinscher, I would be most concerned about... This breed is an interesting choice for an experienced owner who wants to participate with a smart little dog in agility classes (obstacle course for dogs) or in ongoing obedience classes at the intermediate or advanced level. It's not a good choice for novice owners who just want a quiet little pet. I do not recommend Miniature Pinschers for homes with small children. Min Pin puppies can be injured by even a well-meaning child who accidentally steps on, or falls over, the puppy. Some Min Pin adults can feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements of children. And some adults won't tolerate any nonsense and are quick to react to teasing. Many Miniature Pinschers are possessive of their food and toys and will defend these from all comers, including children. Oh, and when you take them outside of their yard, keep that leash on. Miniature Pinschers cannot be trusted off-leash. They will take off – oblivious to your frantic shouts – after anything that runs. Or even if they just feel like it. To teach your Min Pin to listen to you, ""Respect Training"" is mandatory. Read more about Miniature Pinscher Training."
Miniature Poodles," Many people have misconceptions about Poodles – that they are ""sissy"" dogs. That is one of the biggest myths in dogdom. First, ignore the silly show-ring clips. Poodles can be clipped to look like normal dogs. Look at the Miniature Poodle in the photo. That's my girl, Buffy. It takes me 30 minutes every six weeks to bathe her and run over her coat with a handheld clipper (#5 blade), turning her into a shorthaired, normal-looking dog. Second, Miniature Poodles are miniature athletes. They excel in advanced obedience competition, where retrieving and jumping skills are required. They excel in agility (obstacle course) competition, where they dash over and under and through the obstacles with a strength and grace that is breathtaking to watch. But....this breed does come in two different builds. The correct build is ""square"", which means their legs are long enough that their height is approximately equal to their length. Buffy has this build. These Miniature Poodles are both elegant and athletic, moving with a light, springy gait. Other Miniature Poodles are built lower to the ground, with short legs and a long back. These dogs have inherited a physical deformity called chondrodysplasia. It means they don't have the same elegance or agility as a properly square Miniature Poodle. Worse still, it means they're more susceptible to disk disease (though square poodles can develop this disease, too). But whatever the build, a good Miniature Poodle is one of the smartest and most trainable of all breeds. This is a ""thinking"" dog who pays rapt attention to you, learns quickly, and responds well to training. Indeed, Miniature Poodles NEED some sort of mental stimulation in order to be happy, even if it's just challenging games such as hide 'n seek, or fetching a variety of named toys. This intelligent breed should never be relegated to the backyard and ignored. Most Miniature Poodles make great watchdogs, which simply means they will bark when they hear someone at the door. Most individuals tend to be reserved (though polite and non-aggressive) with strangers. But there are also individuals – like my dog Buffy – ""who never met a stranger."" In other words, she considers everyone she meets to be her new best friend! With other dogs and cats, Miniature Poodles are peaceful and accepting. Poodles also have the advantage of being the lightest-shedding, most hypoallergenic of all coated breeds. (Hairless breeds have no hair at all to shed.) So do Miniature Poodles sound like a dream dog? Well, no breed is perfect! Besides the frequent clipping, Poodles do need daily exercise and playtime, as they're typically lively dogs. And Poodles need a great deal of companionship throughout the day. This makes them a great choice for shut-ins or people who work from home. But if everyone is gone for many hours, a Poodle will be unhappy. They're dependent dogs, and if they get lonely, they may bark, or chew destructively. Poodles are also ""pattern-oriented"" dogs who prefer their routines to always be the same. They can get flustered and anxious if you change things too much. Poodles are soft-tempered, sensitive dogs, sometimes hypersensitive. If you touch them unexpectedly or startle them with a sudden loud sound, they tend to flinch. The most sensitive individuals are unhappy around small children. Similarly, Miniature Poodles can get emotionally upset if there's too much activity or conflict or roughhousing in your household. These gentle dogs prefer peace and harmony. You do have to watch your lines.... some Miniature Poodle lines are high-strung and nervous, and this is where you'll find those neurotic Poodles that people scoff about. But how a Poodle turns out also depends on socialization and training. When taken out to experience the world and treated like an intelligent and capable dog, a Miniature Poodle is likely to live up to those expectations. If you want a dog who... A Miniature Poodle may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Miniature Poodle may not be right for you.

In the Poodle's case, it's the amount of clipping they require. To keep their curly coat short and free of mats, Miniature Poodles require clipping every 4 to 6 weeks. Without fail. Professional groomers will try to sculpture your poodle with a shaved face, a topknot on his head, and a pom pom on his tail. That's the frou-frou look that keeps so many people from choosing a poodle. Now, if you like that look, fine. But if you don't like it, take control of how the groomer clips your dog. Or learn how to do it yourself – it's really easy. See photos of my girl Buffy, at the top of the page, and just below. Short coat, whiskery face, short ears, nothing shaved, no topknot or pompoms. Many people are surprised to find out that she's a Poodle. ""She looks like a normal dog,"" they say. Works for me! "
Miniature Schnauzers," Generally speaking, the Miniature Schnauzer has a pleasant, playful, spunky temperament that fits well into a lot of homes. The problem is that it's not very helpful to speak generally about this breed, because individual Miniature Schnauzers vary so much in personality. You'll find some who are serious, some who are goofballs, some who are extroverted, some who are introverted. Some are very terrier-like (high energy, feisty, scrappy, stubborn). Others are so much calmer and sweeter-natured that they're almost like a different breed. With such a range in temperament, it's hard to predict what kind of Mini Schnauzer you'll end up, if you acquire a puppy. If you know the temperament you want, it's safer to adopt an adult. Then you can see exactly what you're getting. The Miniature Schnauzer loves his walks and needs a decent amount of exercise, but mostly he just wants to participate fully in the family. There should be people home during the day to play games with him. Mini Schnauzers are alert watchdogs – sometimes too alert. They may welcome strangers with enthusiasm or be a bit standoffish, even suspicious. The Miniature Schnauzer is usually good with other family pets. Though he may chase the family cat for fun, he's seldom serious about it. However, he may be scrappy with strange dogs of the same sex. Although he knows his own mind and often displays an obstinate resistance to walking on the leash, most Miniature Schnauzers respond well to obedience training. Many individuals win top awards in advanced obedience. This breed is adaptable to different homes, and makes an excellent traveling companion. If you want a dog who... A Miniature Schnauzer may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Miniature Schnauzer may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Miniature Schnauzer If I was considering a Miniature Schnauzer, I would be most concerned about... You must show this breed, through absolute consistency, that you mean what you say. To teach your Miniature Schnauzer to listen to you, ""Respect Training"" is mandatory. My Miniature Schnauzer Training page discusses the program you need."
Mixed Breed Dogs," Also read The Truth About Mixed Breed Dogs. Whether purebred, crossbred, or mixed, all dogs are individuals. But when it comes to predicting what any given individual will be like, mixed breed dogs are the hardest to pin down. A dog of mixed breeding might be energetic or placid. He might be sweet-natured or hard-headed. He might love everyone, or be wary of strangers. He might be dignified or a goofball. I will say this: the extremes of temperament and behavior so often seen in purebred dogs are less common in mixed breeds. This is because purebreds were developed to do a certain type of work. Purebreds located pheasants and rabbits for the hunter to shoot. They herded sheep, drove cattle to market, guarded farms and mansions. They pulled carts and sleds, killed vermin in the barn, assisted police officers, and tracked missing people. To help purebred dogs accomplish their work, useful ""working behaviors"" were bred into their genes. High energy, endurance, independent thinking, strong instincts to chase, to bark, to dig, to guard. Certainly these behaviors can occur in mixed breeds, too, but they are by happenstance, on an ""individual dog"" basis, rather than by deliberate design into a breed as a whole. This tendency of mixed breeds to be less strongly ""programmed"" by their genes can make them more flexible and better able to fit into a variety of households and living conditions. Unfortunately, when you acquire a mixed breed puppy, you can't know what he or she will grow up to be like, because he has inherited a virtual smorgasbord of genes. When you acquire a puppy, you're acquiring potential – what he one day will become. On the other hand, if you acquire an adult mixed breed, you're acquiring what he already IS. This is much easier to see and judge. So if you want a dog who... A mixed breed dog may be right for you. Read The Truth About Mixed Breed Dogs. If you don't want to deal with... A mixed breed dog may not be right for you."
Neapolitan Mastiffs," The Neapolitan Mastiff Standard says: ""The essence of the Neapolitan Mastiff is his beastial appearance, astounding head and imposing size and attitude."" Once you're past the shock of your first impression, you'll be able to better appreciate how quiet, calm, and relaxed this Mastiff is. Just don't mistake his bulk and ambling gait for laziness or clumsiness, for he can shift into his fierce protector's role on a moment's notice. The Neapolitan Mastiff is not an apartment dog – to stay fit, he needs some space and moderate exercise. But more than anything else, he requires ongoing personal attention. He often attaches himself, shadow-like, to his favorite person. Neapolitan Mastiff puppies should be friendly and trusting, and with proper socialization, become more reserved and discriminating as they mature. As with all mastiffs, socialization is an absolute requirement to avoid either aggression or shyness. Dog aggression can be a real problem; though many ""Neos"" will not start fights, they will surely finish them. This massive, stubborn breed is inclined to do things his own way. But he does respond to early, consistent training that includes leadership (YOU!), cheerful praise, and food rewards. Neapolitan Mastiffs perform admirably in drooling, slobbering, and snoring competitions. If you want a dog who... A Neapolitan Mastiff may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Neapolitan Mastiff may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Neapolitan Mastiff If I was considering an Neapolitan Mastiff, I would be most concerned about... Without careful socialization, a Mastiff may be suspicious of everyone. This can lead to either aggression or shyness, and both attitudes are dangerous in a giant breed. Fearful Neapolitan Mastiffs can bite defensively if they feel cornered. And it's no fun trying to drag a huge frightened dog along by the leash in public. To teach your Neapolitan Mastiff to listen to you, ""Respect Training"" is mandatory. Read more about Neapolitan Mastiff Training. In summary, the Neapolitan Mastiff is definitely ""too much dog"" for the average household. This is a breed for experienced owners only, who want a specific type of dog and who can handle that dog."
Newfoundlands," The AKC Standard says, ""Sweetness of temperament is the hallmark of the Newfoundland."" Calm, dignified, and generally quiet, this big breed does best in a spacious home in the suburbs or country, preferably in a non-humid climate, ideally with access to a lake or pond. Newfoundlands love love love the water! To stay fit, a Newf needs long daily walks. He loves to romp in the snow, and pulling a cart or carrying a backpack gives him a purpose in life. Did I mention that he loves to swim? This kindly breed is good-natured with everyone, especially children, though they should be as well-behaved as he is. He is very sociable and needs more companionship than many other breeds. Newfoundlands don't do well when left alone for long periods. Early socialization with lots of nice people and other dogs is critical in developing a stable temperament. Some male Newfoundlands are aggressive with other male dogs, and a very few may be dominant-aggressive toward people. Excessive shyness is also seen. Though good-natured, the Newfoundland must learn his manners, but he is not a pushover to train. He has an independent streak. But he does respond well to patient obedience training. Motivate him with praise and food rewards rather than jerking on the leash, for this breed may have a giant body, but his mind and heart are sensitive. Harshness only makes him skittish and distrustful. Females are most willing to please, while males may be more hardheaded. Newfoundlands pant a lot, drink a lot (sometimes dunking half of their head into their water bucket), and are champion droolers. If you want a dog who... A Newfoundland may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Newfoundland may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Newfoundland If I was considering a Newfoundland, I would be most concerned about... Since you have to minimize their exercise, young Newfoundlands can be very rambunctious. They will romp with uncoordinated gawkiness all over your house. You need to substitute extra quantities of companionship and supervision. Otherwise, left alone, young Newfoundlands become bored and destructive, and their powerful jaws can literally destroy your living room.

Norfolk Terriers," True representatives of what a terrier is supposed to be, Norfolk Terriers are full of fire and stubborn assertiveness. Yet they are more agreeable and companionable than some other terriers. The Norfolk Terrier can adapt to any home with moderate exercise (brisk walks and active play sessions) and lots of companionship. These sociable dogs like to be with their owners and demand full participation in all activities. Their reaction to strangers may be friendly, but is more often a bit reserved. Because of this, Norfolk Terriers do need more socialization than some other terriers, so their natural caution doesn't become exaggerated. These alert dogs make excellent watchdogs, but are not aggressive. Norfolk Terriers usually get along (though can be a bit jealous, possessive, and bossy) with other dogs and cats in the family. Being true terriers, they tend to be feisty with strange pets. Norfolk Terriers require a leash or fence at all times, as they are inquisitive and independent dogs with strong chasing instincts. To the casual eye, the Norfolk Terrier is virtually identical to the Norwich Terrier, with the most obvious difference being ear carriage The Norfolk has drop ears, while the Norwich has pricked ears. In temperament, some terrier enthusiasts say the Norfolk Terrier has a feistier temperament and is ""busier"" than the Norwich, but it's really a matter of individual personality. If you want a dog who... A Norfolk Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Norfolk Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Norfolk Terrier If I was considering a Norfolk Terrier, I would be most concerned about... I don't recommend terriers for home with small children. Many terriers will not tolerate any nonsense from little life forms whom they consider to be below themselves in importance. Many terriers are quick to react to teasing, and even to the normal clumsiness that comes with small children (accidental squeezing of their ears or stepping on their paw). Many terriers are possessive of their food and toys and will defend these from all comers, including children."
Norwegian Buhunds," The Norwegian Buhund is a happy-go-lucky dog who plays vigorously, yet is light on his feet and very agile. Because the Buhund was bred to work all day (he is a herding breed), you must provide plenty of physical exercise and mental stimulation. Agility classes are a great outlet for his energy and enthusiasm. Also hiking, running at the dog park, and chasing balls and frisbees. The Buhund is not a breed to leave alone all day. He likes to be at the center of his family, demanding (and offering) a great deal of companionship. Most Norwegian Buhunds are polite (or a bit wary) with strangers. With their keen senses and watchful attitude, they make dependable alarm dogs – sometimes too dependable, i.e. barking can easily get out of control. To make matters worse, the Buhund has a rapid, high-pitched bark that can set your teeth on edge. Norwegian Buhunds are usually fine with other family pets if raised with them. This breed is less headstrong and more willing to work with you, compared with other spitz breeds. (A spitz is a type of dog with a thick furry coat, pricked ears, curled tail, and foxy face.) But he still has an independent mind of his own, and may use his intelligence in clever ways that suit his own purposes. Yet owners who know how to lead will find him eminently trainable. If you want a dog who... A Norwegian Buhund may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Norwegian Buhund may not be right for you.

Norwegian Elkhounds," The AKC Standard says, ""Bold and energetic, an effective guardian yet normally friendly, with great dignity and independence of character."" Definitely this is a capable, confident dog with a strong presence, whose self-reliance requires supervision and leadership. The Norwegian Elkhound is a bundle of energy just waiting for the signal to go. This rugged breed plays hard and enjoys vigorous exercise – leashed or in a safe enclosed area, for many Elkhounds have strong hunting and chasing instincts. Most Norwegian Elkhounds are friendly with strangers and must be taught not to jump up into their faces. Others are more restrained with strangers. But even the friendly ones are great watchdogs, meaning they are keenly alert for anything out of the ordinary. When they see or hear anything unusual, they bark. And bark. And bark. Elkhounds are very vocal dogs. They hunt by cornering their prey and feinting to and fro to hold it in position, all the while barking nonstop to signal their location to the hunter. Couple that with their high-pitched, piercing voice, and.... well, let's just say you will upset your neighbors if you leave this breed outside unsupervised. Norwegian Elkhounds usually get along well with other family pets if raised with them. But some individuals can be aggressive with other dogs of the same sex, and some are confirmed cat chasers. Remember, this is a hunting breed. Training can be a challenge, as the Elkhound is dominant and headstrong and may use his intelligence in clever ways that suit his own purposes. Yet owners who know how to lead will find him eminently trainable. If you want a dog who... A Norwegian Elkhound may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with...

Norwegian Lundehunds," Many prospective owners find the Norwegian Lundehund's appearance immediately attractive. Size is between small and medium-sized, a perfect size for many households. The short coat is easy to groom and the color pattern is lovely. Moving with a light, springy gait, the Lundehund is as swift, graceful, and agile as a fox, and is a surefooted climber and jumper. Happy and playful, the Norwegian Lundehund will pounce on his food and toys, grasping them with his toes and tossing them into the air like a cat catching a mouse. He also hides his food and toys, going to great lengths to find just the right place to stash his treasures. The Lundehund is not just observant – he is hyper-observant, 100 percent aware of his surroundings, in the same way a wild or feral dog is. He will sound the alarm at anything out of the ordinary, not from a position of aggression, but from a position of defensiveness. The Lundehund is wary of strangers and requires early and extensive socialization to build a confident temperament. Training is a challenge. Norwegian Lundehunds learn quickly, but not necessarily what you want them to learn! Instead their intelligence is more like cleverness, where the dog decides what he wants, then goes about getting it. Lundehunds are persistent problem-solvers and master manipulators. They are not deterred by obstacles such as cupboard doors blocking their access to tasty food. Confinement to a crate or back yard is just one more obstacle to overcome. And if they outsmart you once, they remember. Housebreaking is notoriously difficult – some Lundehunds are never completely housebroken and require a doggy door to the outdoors. The door should lead into a small confined potty area with a high fence. These cliever, athletic dogs can both jump and climb! The most serious concern with Norwegian Lundehunds is their health. The lifespan of this breed is unpredictable because of severe inherited intestinal disorders that are embedded in the breed's gene pool. These intestinal disorders are forms of colitis, also called inflammatory bowel syndrome or protein-losing enteropathy. Norwegian Lundehunds require a high-protein, low-fat, homemade diet, plus regular bloodwork and fecal tests throughout their life. If you want a dog who... A Norwegian Lundehund may be right for you.

Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers," To the casual eye, the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever looks somewhat like a Golden Retriever, but with a more copper-colored coat and white markings. But in temperament, these breeds are very different. Compared to Golden Retrievers, most Tollers are less submissive, less outgoing with strangers, and less adaptable to a low-exercise household. This high-energy breed is a joy in the right hands – but ""too much dog"" for someone who is looking for an eager-to-please couch potato. High-spirited and playful, quick moving and agile, the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever needs plenty of exercise, especially fetching and swimming. Mental exercise (advanced obedience, agility, tracking, field work) is just as important. This breed is not a good choice for a casual pet. Reaction to strangers varies from reserved to curious, but often includes some initial caution. He needs early and ongoing socialization to avoid suspiciousness or timidity. The Toller is usually fine with other family pets. He may chase your cat, but seldom means any harm. Though bright and clever, most Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are easily distracted and easily bored, which can make training more difficult. Other Tollers are surprisingly strong-willed, testing your rules to see what they can get away with. You must demonstrate consistent leadership and keep training sessions short, upbeat, and challenging. As with all retrievers, the Toller can be ""mouthy"" – you must control his tendency to chew on objects and to mouth your hands. Provide a box filled with toys so he can carry something around in his mouth. When excited or anxious, Tollers tend to whine and ""whistle"", which can be irritating when done to excess. If you want a dog who... A Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever may not be right for you.

More traits and characteristics of the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever If I was considering a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, I would be most concerned about... If you want an easy-to-live-with pet who doesn't need much exercise and sleeps most of the day, this is not the breed for you. Most Tollers want to run and hike and swim and play fetch games and participate in field work (hunting), or agility (obstacle course), or advanced obedience, or tracking, or a similar canine activity."
Old English Sheepdogs," Good-natured and sociable, enthusiastic and bumptious, the Old English Sheepdog does best in the suburbs or country, with at least an hour of daily exercise and space to romp. The OES (or ""Sheepie"") loves people, can be quite the clown, and is demanding of attention. If left without the companionship of humans or other pets, he will become unhappy, destructive, and noisy. Most Old English Sheepdogs are polite with strangers. They make sensible watchdogs with a deep, ringing bark, but they're not guard dogs. In fact, there is timidity and skittishness in some lines, sharpness in others. Extensive socialization is important to develop a confident, stable temperament. Like other herding breeds, a few Old English Sheepdogs may try to ""herd"" children and other pets by circling, poking, or nipping at them. However, since the vast majority of Old English Sheepdogs are bred to be show dogs or pets, rather than working sheepdogs, their herding instincts are typically diminished or absent. The rustic Old English Sheepdog is not for fastidious households. He tracks in mud, splashes in his water bowl, and affectionately thrusts his wet and/or dirty beard into your lap. Some individuals drool. If you want a dog who... An Old English Sheepdog may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Old English Sheepdog may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Old English Sheepdog If I was considering an Old English Sheepdog, I would be most concerned about... If you leave the coat long, the Sheepie manifests ""shaggy dog syndrome."" This is where leaves, mud, snow, fecal matter, and other debris cling to the coat and ends up all over your house. When he drinks, his beard absorbs water, which drips on your floors when he walks away. When he eats, his beard absorbs food so that when he sniffs your face or presses his head against your leg, YOU end up dirty, too. Big shaggy dogs are not suited to fastidious housekeepers!"
Otterhounds," The Otterhound has been described as a ""big friendly dog with a mind of his own."" Though amiable and easygoing, this rugged dog belongs in a rural area with an outdoorsy owner who can give him the exercise he loves. Swimming is an especially appreciated form of recreation. These hunting hounds were born to dive into water, whether it be a lake or a puddle. Or he might simply submerge his shaggy head in his drinking bowl and come up shaking. A leash or secure fence is a must at all times, for the nose of this great hunter is exquisitely sensitive, always seeking out new and exciting scents. Once he's latched on to something, his perseverance and determination (like those of his relative, the Bloodhound) are legendary. Otterhounds tend to shamble along with a loose, shuffling gait, without lifting their big feet much off the ground. The Otterhound's reaction to strangers varies from friendly to reserved. Most are good watchdogs but not guard dogs.  Most Otterhounds are fine with other dogs, but remember his hunting heritage – small pets are not always safe. Obedience training takes time and effort, for he is stubborn and independent. But not usually dominant; in other words, though he'll be slow to obey, he'll be good-natured about it! With their propensity for slobbering water, lumbering around in a rather klutzy manner, and tracking in mud with their hairy webbed feet, Otterhounds are not good choices for fastidious housekeepers or those with no sense of humor. Also they have a loud, deep, distinctive bay that carries for amazingly long distances. Your neighbors will not appreciate it if you leave an Otterhound outside, unsupervised. If you want a dog who... An Otterhound may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... An Otterhound may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Otterhound If I was considering an Otterhound, I would be most concerned about... Otterhounds should not be trusted off-leash. They will take off – oblivious to your frantic shouts – after anything that emits an odor or runs."
Papillons," The Papillon shares top billing with the Toy Poodle as the brightest and most trainable of the toy breeds. Indeed, the spirited, athletic Papillon is commonly chosen by obedience or agility trainers who want a top-notch competition dog in a very small package. Indoors and out, Papillons are lively and playful, yet also light-footed and graceful – not likely to topple lamps. But that doesn't mean everyone who is looking for a toy breed should acquire a Papillon. They're not the best choice, for example, if you want a calm, cuddly lapdog. Most Papillons are active, inquisitive dogs, especially when they're young. They don't like to sit still for very long. My own Papillon (that's Jenna in the photo above) is frequently in motion and obsessed with retrieving squeaky balls – for hours. She is also clever and creative and will entertain herself by making up her own games. The Papillon learns very quickly and responds well to training methods that emphasize praise and food. These sensitive dogs wilt if you jerk them around on the leash. However, obedience may not be instantaneous. Some Papillons, especially females, can be manipulative and will try to charm you out of making them do things they don't want to do. If that fails, they'll try sulking. You need to be both gentle and persistent if you are to outwit these clever girls. Papillons are alert dogs with keen senses. That means they not only sound the alarm when people are actually at the door, but also when people are walking along the street or puttering in the garden next door. In other words, excessive barking can occur and must be dealt with. This is a common trait in most toy breeds. Most Papillons are polite with strangers, though often standoffish. As with all sweet-natured breeds, socialization is very important to build a confident attitude toward people. Papillons can be touch-sensitive and can be overwhelmed by the roughhousing and mischief of small children. This breed does better in an adult-only home. With other animals, surprisingly, the Papillon is not as submissive as you might think. In fact, some Papillons are possessive and bossy, especially toward larger dogs. This can be dangerous, as the quick-moving Papillon may be viewed as prey. Note that I said ""quick-moving Papillon."" A hallmark of this breed is how quickly they move. These swift little dogs can zip through a cracked door and be gone in an instant. Our petsitter calls our Papillon a ""spirit"", because ""First she's here, then she's there.... but we never actually see her move, she's like a blur!"" Along the same lines, Papillons have lightning-quick reflexes and retain sporting instincts from their spaniel heritage. They will stalk and pursue birds, squirrels, mice, lizards, even flying insects. This is not a breed to let off-leash at the park unless very well-trained. You do have to watch your lines. Some Papillons are dainty, even high-strung, while others are more confident and outgoing. Much depends on genetics (parents' and grandparents' temperament) and the rest on socialization and training. If you want a dog who... A Papillon may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Papillon may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Papillon If I was considering a Papillon, I would be most concerned about... Papillon puppies are not suited to toddlers, no matter how well-meaning the child. Children cannot help being clumsy, and that a child meant well is little solace to a Papillon who has been accidentally stepped on, sat on, rolled on, squeezed, or dropped onto the patio. Even adult Papillons may feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making, and stress and fearfulness may be the result."
Pekingese," The AKC Standard says the Pekingese ""should imply courage, boldness, and self-esteem, rather than prettiness, daintiness, or delicacy."" Indeed, the Pekingese is dignified, supremely confident, and one of the most independent (and stubborn) of the toy breeds. Calm and quiet indoors, the Peke is content to lie on the sofa cushions much of the time, observing his kingdom with his direct, inscrutable gaze. Yet he will also surprise you with sudden bursts of comic playfulness. Some individuals are more lively than others. Most Pekingese are loyal to their owner without being clingy. They are usually polite with strangers and other animals. This proud, self-possessed dog is a superb choice for an adults-only home, and especially for senior citizens. But I don't recommend him with children, as he won't meekly submit to mischief or rough handling from anyone. He can also be possessive of his food and toys. The Pekingese can be exasperatingly willful, but also surprisingly sensitive. He resents being jerked around or even scolded. However, if he respects you, he will be well-mannered without much formal training required. With his short (unfortunately deformed) face, he must go through life snorting, snuffling, sneezing, and snoring. If you want a dog who... A Pekingese may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Pekingese may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Pekingese If I was considering a Pekingese, I would be most concerned about... Instead you should establish the right relationship where you are the leader and he is the follower. In other words, you must teach your Pekingese to respect you. Read more about Pekingese training."
Pembroke Welsh Corgis," Spirited and athletic, steady and dependable, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a true ""big dog on short legs."" Herding, obedience, agility, or chasing balls (with surprising speed) are enjoyable outlets for his enthusiasm and desire to work. Corgis are smart dogs who need something to do. If his days include such moderate exercise, along with the loving companionship of his family, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi is adaptable and easy to live with. He is polite with guests, reserved with strangers, and makes an alert watchdog. Often too alert – Corgis can be serious barkers. Most Pembroke Welsh Corgis are fine with other family pets. But they're often territorial with strange dogs and cats – as a working farm dog, one of his responsibilities was to chase strays away from his own farm. Corgis are wonderful with livestock, including horses. This attentive breed learns quickly and responds well to obedience training – better than his close cousin, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. Yet he has the independent judgment and problem-solving abilities of a true herding breed, so you must have the confidence to establish and consistently enforce rules, or he may make up his own. If you want a dog who... A Pembroke Welsh Corgi may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Pembroke Welsh Corgi may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi If I was considering a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, I would be most concerned about... I recommend that you get your Pembroke Welsh Corgi involved in regular obedience classes (beyond the beginners level – join a dog club and go every week). Also consider agility classes (an obstacle course for dogs) or even herding, if there is a herding club in your area. Also consider my book, Teach Your Dog 100 English Words, because teaching your dog words and games stimulates his brain and keeps him happy!"
Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen," The AKC Standard says, ""Bold and vivacious in character... tough and robust in construction... an alert outlook, lively bearing, and a good voice freely used."" I just love that last phrase: ""a good voice freely used."" It means, ""They bark and bay, especially when hunting, but also when restless or bored or left alone too much."" The Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen (PBGV or ""Petit"", for short) is actually more like a terrier than a basset. In other words, he is lively, enthusiastic, curious, reacts quickly to interesting scents and sudden movements, and is always looking for something to do. The PBGV plays vigorously and needs long daily walks and frequent romps. But this inquisitive sniffing machine should not be trusted off-leash, for he is a confirmed chaser who will follow his nose, right into trafic. He may sound off (in a surprisingly deep bass) when strangers enter his territory, but then he welcomes them with happy wags. This is not a guard dog! Most PBGVs are also extroverted with other dogs and cats. But with his hunting background, pet rabbits and rodents are not a wise addition to the household. This stubborn, clever little hound requires an owner who knows when to laugh at his appealing whiskery face and mischievous antics – and when to be firm and in control. Not recommended for novice owners or couch potatoes. If you want a dog who... A Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

More traits and characteristics of the Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen If I was considering a Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen, I would be most concerned about... The Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen should not be trusted off-leash. These hunting hounds will take off, oblivious to your frantic shouts, after anything that runs. The longer the coat is, the more a PBGV displays ""shaggy dog syndrome."" This is where leaves, mud, snow, fecal matter, and other debris cling to the coat and ends up in your house. When he drinks, his beard absorbs water, which drips on your floors when he walks away. When he eats, his beard absorbs food so that when he sniffs your face or presses his head against your leg, YOU end up dirty, too. Shaggy dogs are not suited to fastidious housekeepers!"
Pharaoh Hounds," The AKC Standard says, ""Of noble bearing with hard clean-cut lines... very fast with a marked keenness for hunting."" The Pharaoh Hound belongs to a family of dogs called sighthounds, which were originally developed to hunt other animals. The slender, long-legged sighthound hunts by spotting movement across a vast distance, then running the animal down with lightning speed. The Pharaoh Hound is athletic and playful, light on his feet and a jumper par excellence. Pharaoh Hounds move gracefully through your house, though some sprinting and leaping should also be expected. This breed can be most entertaining if you have a sense of humor. Pharaoh Hounds are fond of being comfortable and can curl themselves into a surprisingly compact ball to fit whichever nook or cranny has the softest blankets. The Pharaoh Hound needs a good deal of exercise, but is so swift and agile and has such powerful chasing instincts that he must be allowed to run only in a safe, enclosed area. Otherwise he'll be out of sight in a jiffy, pursuing anything that runs. Usually sociable with other dogs, Pharaoh Hounds will pursue any smaller animal that runs. Though extremely alert and quick to announce strangers, the Pharaoh Hound is not a guard dog. Indeed, he is both curious and cautious, hesitantly investigating new people, places, sights, and sounds. Early and ongoing socialization is required to avoid suspiciousness and build confidence. Unlike most breeds in the sighthound family, the Pharaoh Hound can be quite a barker! This sensitive breed prefers peace and quiet and soft-spoken people. He does not do well in an environment with chronic tension or loud voices. This independent thinker is also sensitive to correction, so he should be handled calmly and motivated with food and praise. Sighthounds are often touch-sensitive, tending to startle when touched unexpectedly and uncomfortable when cuddled excessively. A verbal correction and verbal praise can be more effective than physical touch, because they are less distracting to the dog. If you want a dog who... A Pharaoh Hound may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Pharaoh Hound may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Pharaoh Hound If I was considering a Pharaoh Hound, I would be most concerned about... See if there is a dog club in your area that offers an activity called lure coursing, which is chasing a mechanical lure in a controlled setting. This is an appropriate outlet for the full-speed galloping behaviors that are ""hardwired"" into your Pharaoh Hound's genes. If you have toddlers, I do not recommend a Pharaoh Hound. These sensitive dogs often feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making – and stress and shyness may be the result."
Polish Lowland Sheepdogs," The Polish Lowland Sheepdog (nicknamed PON from his Polish name ""Polish Owczark Nizinny"") is a lively working dog. Strong and durable, athletic and agile, he requires daily exercise and does best with active outdoorsy owners. Mental stimulation in the form of advanced obedience classes, agility classes, or herding livestock, is even more important to this intelligent breed. When these needs are met, the Polish Lowland Sheepdog is calm and stable and settles down happily indoors. Somewhat aloof and suspicious of strangers, the PON makes a vigilant watchdog. In fact, socialization must be early and thorough so that his watchfulness does not sharpen into suspiciousness or shyness. Most Polish Lowland Sheepdogs are dominant toward other dogs, especially of the same sex. Those with a high prey drive are not reliable around little creatures that run or flutter. These confident dogs were bred to think independently and make their own decisions, and they will do exactly that unless you take charge and establish the rules. They are persistent problem-solvers (""If I can't get what I want this way, maybe I can get it this way."") and can be dominant and manipulative. Not a good breed for a novice owner. Nor is this rustic (shaggy) breed a good choice for the immaculate household. Mud, snow, and leaves cling to his tousled coat, and his beard collects water and food remnants and can become matted and smelly. If you want a dog who... A Polish Lowland Sheepdog may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Polish Lowland Sheepdog may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Polish Lowland Sheepdog If I was considering a Polish Lowland Sheepdog, I would be most concerned about... If you leave the coat long, the Polish Lowland Sheepdog manifests ""shaggy dog syndrome."" This is where leaves, mud, snow, fecal matter, and other debris cling to the coat and ends up in your house. When the dog drinks, his beard absorbs water, which drips on your floors when he walks away. When he eats, his beard absorbs food so that when he sniffs your face or presses his head against your leg, YOU end up dirty, too. Shaggy dogs are not suited to fastidious housekeepers!"
Pomeranians," The AKC Standard says the Pomeranian is ""inquisitive by nature... cocky, commanding, and animated."" That he is. Vivacious and spirited, bold and brash, the typical Pomeranian thinks he's ""hot stuff."" This sharp-eyed busybody likes to check out every sight, sound, and activity – and tell you what he thinks about it. He is delightfully alive and aware of everything going on around him. Keenly alert to approaching strangers, the Pomeranian makes a great alarm dog. But this can easily get out of hand, so he requires early socialization so that he doesn't become sharp or shrill. Most Pomeranians are fine with other pets. It is a tribute to their amiability that male Pomeranians can often run and play together with little or no bickering. Some Poms, though, are bossy and will attempt to chase strange dogs, regardless of size. The Pomeranian is very bright and will look directly at you, cocking his head attentively. BUT he is not inclined to take orders from anyone whom he views as below himself in importance. So don't allow him to make the rules or you will lose control over his behavior. For example, don't allow him to act possessive of his food or toys, and control his barking from day one. This proud, self-possessed little breed won't meekly submit to mischief or rough handling and is not a good choice for children. If you want a dog who... A Pomeranian may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Pomeranian may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Pomeranian If I was considering a Pomeranian, I would be most concerned about... Pomeranian puppies are not suited to toddlers, no matter how well-meaning the child. Children cannot help being clumsy, and that a child meant well is little solace to a Papillon who has been accidentally stepped on, sat on, rolled on, squeezed, or dropped onto the patio. Even adult Poms may feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making, and stress and fearfulness may be the result. Also many Pomeranians won't tolerate any nonsense from children."
Standard Poodles," Many people have misconceptions about Poodles -- that they look and act like ""sissy"" dogs. That is one of the biggest myths in dogdom. First, ignore the silly show-ring clips. Poodles can be clipped into shorthaired, normal -looking dogs who are a snap to brush. Poodles also have the advantage of being the lightest-shedding, most hypoallergenic of all coated breeds. Second, Standard Poodles are elegant, energetic athletes who move with a light, springy gait. They excel in advanced obedience competition, where retrieving and jumping skills are required, and in agility (obstacle course) competitions, where they fly over and under and through the obstacles with a strength and grace that is breathtaking to watch. Even better, a good Standard Poodle is one of the smartest and most trainable of all breeds. He is a ""thinking"" dog who pays rapt attention to his owner, learns quickly, and responds eagerly to positive training methods. Indeed, Standard Poodles NEED some sort of mental stimulation in order to be happy -- advanced obedience classes (not just basic), agility classes, or challenging games such as hide 'n seek, or fetching a variety of named toys. This intelligent breed cannot simply sit in the backyard and be ignored. Most Standard Poodles make great watchdogs and some even have mild (and sensible) protective instincts, but this is not an aggressive breed. Their attitude toward people varies from friendly to politely reserved. Early socialization is important to avoid excessive watchfulness or timidity. With other dogs and cats, Standard Poodles are usually peaceful and accepting. However, this breed is by no means perfect or low-maintenance. Besides the regular clipping (every 4-6 weeks), they need a good deal of daily exercise. Their energy level varies from moderate to high and they require brisk walks, jogging, swimming, and/or vigorous play sessions to keep them fit, satisfied, and calm indoors. Standard Poodles also need a lot of daily companionship. They suffer from loneliness and separation anxiety if left alone too much. Most Standard Poodles are ""soft"" and sensitive dogs, sometimes hypersensitive. If you touch them unexpectedly or startle them with a sudden loud sound, they tend to flinch. The most sensitive individuals are not good with small children. Similarly, Standard Poodles can get emotionally upset if there's too much activity or conflict or roughhousing in your household -- they prefer peace and harmony. You do have to watch your lines: some Standard Poodle lines are high-strung, nervous, even neurotic. If you want a dog who... A Standard Poodle may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Standard Poodle may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament  is less predictable than the inheritance of physical  traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training.

It makes me sad to see these extremely intelligent and capable dogs relegated to homes where the owner just wanted a casual pet. It's a waste of a brilliant breed. I strongly encourage you to get your Standard Poodle involved in advanced obedience classes and agility (obstacle course) classes at your local dog club. These dogs deserve it."
Toy Poodles," Many people have misconceptions about Poodles – that they look and act like ""sissy"" dogs. That is one of the biggest myths in dogdom. First, ignore the silly show-ring clips. Poodles can be clipped to look like normal dogs. See the pic of my cream Poodle, Buffy? It takes me 15 minutes every 6 weeks to run over her coat with a handheld clipper (#5 blade) and turn her into a shorthaired, normal-looking dog who is a snap to brush. Poodles also have the advantage of being the lightest-shedding, most hypoallergenic of all coated breeds. If you have allergies, a Poodle is the safest breed for you. Second, far from being sissy cushion-sitters, Toy Poodles are miniature athletes. They excel in advanced obedience competition, where retrieving and jumping skills are required, and in agility (obstacle course) competitions, where they fly over and under and through the obstacles with a strength and grace that is breathtaking to watch.  I do need to mention the two different builds, though. The correct build for the breed is ""square"", which means their legs are long enough that their height is approximately equal to their length. These Toy Poodles are both elegant and athletic, moving with a light, springy gait. Other Toy Poodles are built lower to the ground, with short legs and a long back -- these dogs have inherited a physical deformity called chondrodysplasia. They don't have the same elegance or agility as square Toy Poodles and they are more susceptible to disk disease. But whatever the build, a good Toy Poodle is one of the smartest and most trainable of all breeds. He is a ""thinking"" dog who pays rapt attention to his owner, learns quickly, and responds eagerly to positive training methods. Indeed, Toy Poodles NEED some sort of mental stimulation in order to be happy, even if it's just challenging games such as hide 'n seek, or fetching a variety of named toys. This intelligent breed cannot simply sit in the backyard and be ignored. Most Toy Poodles make great watchdogs -- they will bark sharply at the door and they tend to be reserved (though polite and non-aggressive) with strangers. But there are also individuals like my dog Buffy, ""who never met a stranger."" (She loves everyone.) With other dogs and cats, Toy Poodles are peaceful and accepting. However, this breed is by no means perfect. Besides the regular clipping, they do need daily exercise, as they are lively dogs. And they do need a lot of daily companionship. They suffer from loneliness and separation anxiety if left alone too much. Poodles also learn ""patterns"" so quickly that they tend to anticipate everything you're going to do next, which can be disconcerting. They expect their routines to always be the same, and they can get flustered if you change things. Poodles are ""soft"" and sensitive dogs, sometimes hypersensitive. If you touch them unexpectedly or startle them with a sudden loud sound, they tend to flinch. The most sensitive individuals are not good with small children. Similarly, Toy Poodles can get emotionally upset if there's too much activity or conflict or roughhousing in your household -- they prefer peace and harmony. You do have to watch your lines: some Toy Poodle lines are too high-strung and nervous, and this is where you'll find those neurotic Poodles that people scoff at. But much also depends on socialization and training -- i.e., when brought out to experience the world and treated like an intelligent, capable fellow, he is likely to live up to these expectations. However, Toy Poodles are not for children. Some Toy Poodles are such gentle souls they are overwhelmed by the roughhousing and mischief of small children, while others simply won't put up with it.  If you want a dog who... A Toy Poodle may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Toy Poodle may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Toy Poodle If I was considering a Toy Poodle, I would be most concerned about... Professional groomers will sculpture your poodle with a shaved face, a topknot on his head, and a pom pom on his tail. That's the frou-frou look that keeps so many people from choosing a poodle. Now, if you like that look, fine. But if you don't like it, just take control of how the groomer clips your dog. Or learn how to do it yourself – it's really easy. See girl Buffy below. (She is a purebred poodle, but larger than a Toy and smaller than a Miniature.) Short coat, whiskery face, short ears, nothing shaved, no topknot or pompoms. Many people are surprised to find out that she's a Poodle. ""She looks like a normal dog,"" they say. Works for me! "
Portuguese Water Dogs," The AKC Standard calls him ""an animal of spirited disposition, self-willed, brave, and very resistant to fatigue."" Emotionally the Portuguese Water Dog is stable and sensible. Physically he is lively and athletic, poised for any activity. He loves to play and needs vigorous exercise: long walks, occasional runs, and swimming whenever possible, for he is a master swimmer and diver. Mental stimulation is just as important to this clever, thinking breed. Get him involved in the sport of agility or advanced obedience, and play lots of vigorous fetching games. If you're not an outdoorsy person or if you just want an undemanding pet, this is not the breed for you. When well socialized, his reaction to strangers varies from friendly to polite, but he should always remain steadfast and hold his ground. This observant breed makes a fine watchdog, but not a guardian. Most Portuguese Water Dogs are accepting of other pets when raised with them. PWDs are strong-minded, with an independent streak and a wicked sense of humor. Consistent leadership is a must. A natural retriever, the Portuguese Water Dog is a very mouthy dog who will pick up everything in his path, chew up both edible and inedible objects, and try to gnaw on your hands. Provide a box filled with toys so he can satisfy his oral fixation by carrying something around in his mouth. Youngsters are especially rambunctious, bore easily, and without enough attention and structured activity can excavate vast chasms in your yard. If you want a dog who... A Portuguese Water Dog may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Portuguese Water Dog may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Portuguese Water Dog If I was considering a Portuguese Water Dog, I would be most concerned about... It's tempting for owners to think that all misbehaviors can be solved by training. That's not true. Many misbehaviors are caused by the owner failing to provide smart, lively breeds with enough exercise and interesting things to do. So choose your breed wisely!"
Pugs," Sometimes playful and clownish. Sometimes calm and dignified. Always sturdy and stable, good-humored and amiable. This is the Pug. Though peaceful with all the world (people and other animals), the Pug will sound off with his rather odd-sounding bark when visitors arrive. Then he will welcome them inside with snorts, snuffles, and grunts. As is the case with most short-faced dogs, his large expressive eyes, wrinkled forehead, cocked head, innocent expression, and strange sounds bring out parental feelings in many people. Indeed, a Pug is very childlike and always wants to be with you. If not spoiled too much, he can be depended on to maintain his sweet, comical, charming personality. Though stubborn, Pugs seldom get into real mischief. Adults spend much of the day sleeping. Gassiness can be an embarrassing problem, and housebreaking can be a challenge, especially in the rain, which Pugs detest. The biggest concern with this breed is their many serious health problems. If you want a dog who... A Pug may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Pug may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Pug If I was considering a Pug, I would be most concerned about... Instead you should establish the right relationship between the two of you, where you are the leader and he is the follower. In other words, you must teach your Pug to respect you.

Pulis," The acrobatic Puli has been likened to a bouncing spring. Typically he remains lively and playful well into his teens. With boundless energy and insatiable curiosity, he bustles about with light-footed agility, checking out every new sight and sound – and expressing his opinion about it. The Puli is a sturdy herding breed, a superb athlete with quick reflexes. He can turn on a dime and clear a six-foot fence from a standstill. With his keen eyesight, acute hearing, and suspicion of strangers, the Puli is serious about his responsibility as a watchdog. He will rush up to a stranger to take his measure and is willing to back up his loud warning bark with a bite. Since dogs are not the best judges of a person's true intentions, you could end up in legal (and financial) hot water if your Puli bites someone. Extensive socialization is required to keep a Puli from becoming too sharp. Some Pulis are playful with other dogs, while other Pulis are dominant, bossy, and territorial. His high prey drive will send him in rollicking pursuit of small creatures that run. One of the smartest of all breeds, supremely self-confident, the Puli is also one of the most demanding and manipulative. As one breeder puts it, the Puli has ""a capacity for causing mischief that is truly awesome."" This breed is for experienced owners who know how to lead a strong-willed dog. The Puli has an ""in your face"" personality and is accustomed to making his own decisions. He will continue to do so unless you take control with firm leadership and consistent rules. Yet he is also proud and sensitive and won't tolerate harsh handling. If you want a dog who... A Puli may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Puli may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Puli If I was considering a Puli, I would be most concerned about... I recommend that you get your Puli involved in regular obedience classes (beyond the beginners level – join a dog club and go every week). Also consider agility classes (an obstacle course for dogs) or even herding, if there is a herding club in your area. Also consider my book, Teach Your Dog 100 English Words, because teaching your dog words and games stimulates his brain and keeps him happy! Your second option is to brush out the cords whenever they start to form. This produces a natural ""shaggy"" look that simply requires lots of regular brushing. Your third option is to keep the coat trimmed or clipped so it's short and sanitary. This is my favorite option. Again, clipping the coat makes all of these hassles go away."
Rat Terriers," Both sturdy and elegant, and often described as having a dual personality, the Rat Terrier is a tenacious hunter in the field, yet a sensible companion at home. Most Rat Terriers are athletic and agile, LOVE to play, and have a special passion for chasing balls. Your Rat Terrier should be kept in a fenced yard or on-leash, for he is an impulsive explorer who will take off after anything that runs. He is also curious and clever at solving problems, so be sure your fences are high and secure, else he will figure out how to escape. Rat Terriers crave lots of companionship, often using their paws to wrap around your neck or to demand attention. Generally good with other dogs and cats in his own family, the Rat Terrier does have a high prey drive and quick reflexes. He will dispatch squeaky creatures with little effort. Though he has a stubborn streak, he is also smart, sensitive, and attentive. He will cock his head and listen to you if you know how to be a good leader with dogs. Being respectable terriers, Rat Terriers do love to tunnel and dig, so if you have beautiful gardens..... Most Rat Terriers are somewhat vocal – not only barking, but also ""talking"" with a mumbled ra-ra-ra-ra to get your attention when they want something. If you want a dog who... A Rat Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Rat Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Rat Terrier If I was considering a Rat Terrier, I would be most concerned about... To teach your Rat Terrier to listen to you, I recommend ""Respect Training."" Read more about Rat Terrier Training. I do not recommend terriers for small children. Many terriers will not tolerate any nonsense from little life forms whom they consider to be below themselves in importance. Many terriers are quick to react to teasing, and even to the normal clumsiness that comes with small children (accidental squeezing of their ears or stepping on their paw). Many terriers are possessive of their food and toys and will defend these from all comers, including children."
Rhodesian Ridgebacks," This dignified, muscular dog, a combination of scenthound and sighthound, needs brisk walking every day and the chance to run as often as possible. This is not a breed to sit quietly in your house or yard all day. Young Rhodesian Ridgebacks are especially rambunctious, bore easily, and can excavate vast holes – in dirt or in couches. The most territorial of the hound breeds, the Rhodesian Ridgeback is aloof with strangers and should be accustomed to people at an early age so that his guarding instinct remains controlled rather than indiscriminate. Rhodesian Ridgebacks can be dominant with other animals, especially with other dogs of the same sex. Some individuals are fine with the family cat, while others are predatory chasers of anything that runs. This breed is confident and independent, inclined to do things his own way, and will test members of the family to find his place in the pecking order. Consistent leadership and obedience training is a must. Overall, the Rhodesian Ridgeback is a splendid, capable companion for assertive owners. However, without ongoing time and effort, exercise, socialization, and supervision, he is ""too much dog."" If you want a dog who... A Rhodesian Ridgeback may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Rhodesian Ridgeback may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Rhodesian Ridgeback If I was considering a Rhodesian Ridgeback, I would be most concerned about..."
Rottweilers," The AKC Standard describes the Rottweiler as ""a calm, confident, and courageous dog with a self-assured aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships."" Some Rottweilers are serious dogs, while others are happy-go-lucky clowns. But in general, the Rottweiler tends to respond quietly and with a wait-and-see attitude to influences in his environment, like strange sights and sounds. This muscular dog needs some space and exercise: brisk daily walks, interactive romping sessions, and regular opportunities to stretch out and run. Mental exercise is even more important and appreciated. Mental exercise includes advanced obedience classes, agility classes, or even Schutzhund classes if your Rottie is from German Schutzhund lines. Schutzhund is a dog sport that combines protection, obedience, and tracking. Rottweilers must be thoroughly socialized at an early age so that their territorial instincts are controlled rather than indiscriminate. They can be aggressive with other dogs of the same sex. And while many Rottweilers live peacefully with the family cat, other individuals are predatory toward cats. Most Rottweilers are inclined toward dominance and will test for position in the family pecking order. But they will respect an assertive owner who knows how to lead a strong-minded dog. Overall, the Rottweiler is a splendid, capable companion in the right hands. But without ongoing companionship, socialization, obedience training, and supervision, he is ""too much dog"" for many households. If you want a dog who... A Rottweiler may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Rottweiler may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of Rottweilers If I was considering a Rottweiler, I would be most concerned about... With Rottweilers more than most other breeds, you must know what you want long before you start calling or visiting breeders. You need to ask the right questions. Otherwise you might end up with a Rottweiler that isn't at all what you were looking for – and possibly an individual who is too much for you to handle. To make your search even more challenging, some idiot breeders are breeding Rottweilers to be dangerously sharp. ""Sharp"" dogs aren't protective – they're unstable, which makes them more likely to attack an innocent person or another animal. There are also Rottweilers who are skittish or nervous – another form of instability that makes them potentially dangerous. Get your Rottweiler involved in agility (obstacle course), or advanced obedience, or schutzhund, a German protection-dog sport. Play fetch games. Take them hiking. They must have physical outlets for their energy, and mental outlets for their intelligent minds. Since you need to minimize their exercise, young Rottweilers can be rambunctious. They will romp with uncoordinated gawkiness all over your house. You need to substitute extra quantities of companionship and supervision at this time. Otherwise, left alone, young Rottweilers become bored and destructive, and their powerful jaws can destroy your living room. In other words, you must teach your Rottweiler to respect you. A dog who respects you will do what you say and will stop what he's doing when you tell him ""No."" Read more about Rottweiler Training."
Saint Bernards," A well-bred Saint Bernard is calm, relaxed, and sensible. That is, an adult  Saint Bernard is calm, relaxed, and sensible. Young Saints are as boisterous and bouncy and silly as any other breed and must be patiently taught not to jump and not to run around indoors. All Saint Bernards need space and deserve a roomy home with a spacious fenced yard in the suburbs or country. This breed needs daily exercise (whether he seems to want it or not) to stay fit, although long daily walks will do, along with regular opportunities to stretch out and lope around. Most Saints love to romp in the snow, and pulling a cart or carrying a backpack gives him a purpose in life. Companionship is of prime importance to this sociable breed. Left alone too much, he becomes dispirited – and destructive. With strangers, most Saints are relaxed and accepting, but some individuals are more outgoing, while others are more introspective and standoffish. Because of the breed's size and strength, he requires early and frequent excursions into the world so that he grows up to trust (or at least respect) other people. Unfortunately, there are some bad temperament genes in the breed's gene pool. Dogs who inherit genes for a high-strung, timid, or suspicious temperament can be just as difficult to live with as those who inherit genes for aggression. Most Saint Bernards are fine with other animals when raised with them. But there is some dog aggression, which can be frightening to experience because of this breed's sheer bulk and power. Saints have an independent streak, but they are willing to please if you can establish consistent rules through motivational training methods that include praise and food rewards. Saint Bernards are hard to beat as droolers, slobberers, and loud contented snorers. If you want a dog who... A Saint Bernard may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Saint Bernard may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Saint Bernard If I was considering a Saint Bernard, I would be most concerned about... Since you need to minimize their exercise, young Saint Bernards can be rambunctious, romping with uncoordinated gawkiness all over your house. You need to substitute extra quantities of companionship and supervision during this time. Otherwise, left alone, young Saint Bernards become bored and destructive, and their powerful jaws can literally destroy your living room. I strongly recommend that you get your Saint Bernard involved in obedience classes at the intermediate or advanced level, or pulling a cart or sled, or hiking and swimming. In other words, you must teach your Saint Bernard to respect you. A dog who respects you will do what you say and will stop what he's doing when you tell him ""No."" Read more about Saint Bernard Training."
Salukis," One of the swiftest and most graceful of all breeds, the aristocratic Saluki is possessed of a quiet dignity and independence. Once past the destructive puppy stage,  a Saluki is docile and quiet indoors, a creature of comfort who prefers soft beds and sofas on which he can lounge and survey his domain. However, his fragile appearance is deceiving: At full gallop he is so incredibly fast (up to forty-five miles per hour) and has such strong chasing instincts that he must not be let off-leash except in a safe, enclosed area. And he is an agile jumper, so fences should be at least six feet high. Salukis are aloof (often cautious) with strangers and require early socialization to encourage a confident attitude. Generally sociable with other dogs, a Saluki will pursue anything that runs, including small pets, and he can react with lightning reflexes. The Saluki is an independent thinker, yet sensitive to correction, so he should be trained calmly and coaxed with food and games. However, this breed does need firm boundaries or he will take advantage. Many sighthounds are touch-sensitive, tending to startle if touched unexpectedly and uncomfortable when cuddled excessively. If you want a dog who... A Saluki may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Saluki may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Saluki If I was considering a Saluki, I would be most concerned about... Salukis need access to a large fenced area – fenced because these independent dogs are likely to take off and not come back. If there is a dog club in your area, get your Saluki involved in lure coursing (chasing a mechanized lure around a track or across an open field). This is an appropriate outlet for the full-speed galloping behaviors that are ""hardwired"" into his genes. In other words, you must teach your Saluki to respect you. A dog who respects you will do what you say and will stop what he's doing when you tell him ""No."" Read more about Saluki Training."
Samoyeds," The Samoyed is gentle and dependable in heart and mind -- robust and spirited in body. This playful dog enjoys vigorous outdoor exercise, especially in cold weather. Without such outlets for his energy, and without sufficient companionship to satisfy his sociable nature, he can be boisterous and destructive. The Samoyed's attitude toward strangers varies from ""Hi there! Come on in!"" (often accompanied by enthusiastic jumping) to more conservative, yet sensible and polite. Most will bark to announce visitors, but that's the extent of their guarding inclination. Samoyeds are usually good with other animals, but with strong chasing and herding instincts, they may take off after trespassing cats or wildlife. A securely fenced yard is a must. One of the brightest and most sensitive of the spitz (northern or sled dog) breeds, yet still demanding and independent, Sammies need consistent leadership and early obedience training. They have a jolly ""sense of humor"" and often exhibit it when disobeying. The Samoyed barks a LOT, and some individuals have high-pitched, extremely piercing voices. If you want a dog who... A Samoyed may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Samoyed may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Samoyed If I was considering a Samoyed, I would be most concerned about... In other words, you must teach your Samoyed to respect you. A dog who respects you will do what you say and will stop what he's doing when you tell him ""No."" Read more about Samoyed Training."
Schipperkes," The AKC Standard describes the Schipperke as ""questioning, mischievous, impudent... interested in everything around him."" Indeed, this is one of the most inquisitive and impulsive of all breeds. The Schipperke is busy, busy, busy and seldom walks when he can trot or scamper. The Schipperke should always be kept on-leash (for he is an extremely fast, agile, independent chaser of anything that moves) or in a secure yard, preferably supervised, because his ingenuity and climbing/digging skills may send him over or under the fence. Possessed of extraordinary senses and an inherent suspicion of strangers, the Schipperke sleeps lightly and makes a keen, vigilant watchdog. He is convinced that he is a big dog and may physically challenge an intruder foolish enough to ignore his sharp, penetrating bark. With dogs and cats in his own family, he is usually fine. With strange pets who invade his domain, he can be scrappy. He has a high prey drive and is likely to harass small caged pets, and with his quick reflexes and light-footed agility, creatures that run won't get far. This little rascal does best with owners who are firm, confident, and consistent. He has a marked stubborn streak, strong likes and dislikes, a mischievous sense of humor, and will take clever advantage if indulged. Schipperkes are proud and sensitive and do not react kindly to being harshly handled or teased. Some can be hard to housebreak, and their barking must be kept under control. If you want a dog who... A Schipperke may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Schipperke may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Schipperke If I was considering a Schipperke, I would be most concerned about... In other words, you must teach your Schipperke to respect you. A dog who respects you will do what you say and will stop what he's doing when you tell him ""No."" Read more about Schipperke Training."
Scottish Deerhounds," Like all sighthounds, the quiet, dignified Scottish Deerhound doesn't behave like most dog breeds you may be used to, like a Golden Retriever or German Shepherd. For example, a Scottish Deerhound is unlikely to fetch a ball or play tug-of-war or protect your family. Oh, certainly, Scottish Deerhound puppies and adolescents are as active, awkward, and mischievous as any other breed. But adults tend to be calm, graceful, and undemanding. They learn house rules well and spend much of their time sprawled blissfully on the softest sofa. Generally sighthounds do not like to be mauled or clutched at; they tend to move away from too much overt physicalness. It is outdoors where Scottish Deerhounds have such special needs. They require space for the long strides of their floating lope (described as ""poetry in motion"") and their powerful, driving gallop. But it must be a safe, enclosed area, else they will be out of sight in seconds and end up dead on the road. It has happened time and time again with sighthounds. Because of his great size, strength, and speed, the Scottish Deerhound does require early socialization, but he is almost unfailingly polite with strangers. This is not a guard dog, sometimes not even a watchdog -- some easygoing individuals will remain comatose when the doorbell rings. Scottish Deerhounds are amiable with other dogs, but are serious chasers of anything that runs, including cats and tiny dogs. Though mildly stubborn and independent, this is also a sweet and sensitive dog. He is willing to respond (albeit in a slow, casual way, as though humoring you) to cheerful training that includes consistent guidance, verbal praise, and food rewards. If you want a dog who... A Scottish Deerhound may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Scottish Deerhound may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Scottish Deerhound If I was considering a Scottish Deerhound, I would be most concerned about... Without the right amount of space and opportunity to exercise, Scottish Deerhounds will become bored, which they usually express by destructive chewing. If there is a dog club in your area, get your Scottish Deerhound involved in lure coursing (chasing a mechanized lure around a track or across an open field). This is an appropriate outlet for the full-speed galloping behaviors that are ""hardwired"" into his genes. In other words, you must teach your Scottish Deerhound to respect you. A dog who respects you will do what you say and will stop what he's doing when you tell him ""No."" Read more about Scottish Deerhound Training."
Scottish Terriers," The AKC Standard says, ""The Scottish Terrier's bold, confident, dignified aspect exemplifies power in a small package... a determined and thoughtful dog whose 'heads up, tails up' attitude in the ring should convey both fire and control."" Friendly and playful as a puppy, the Scottie matures into a bold, jaunty, yet steady and dignified adult, with greater independence than most terriers. He is staunchly self-reliant and fearless – also a bit dour and crusty at times. The Scottish Terrier is content with daily walks and not built for long-distance jogging, but he will pursue squirrels and chipmunks with rollicking enthusiasm. Steadfastly loyal to his owner (some are one-person dogs) and reserved with strangers, the Scottish Terrier makes an intimidating watchdog. He should be socialized with lots of people at an early age and not allowed to be sharp. He can be scrappy with other dogs. Training is a challenge, for no breed has higher self-esteem or a stronger will. This is not a dog for permissive owners! Firm, consistent leadership is a must, and obedience training should be praise- and food-based, for the Scottie is proud, sensitive, and easily insulted. He may retaliate or ""go on strike"" if jerked around or pushed too far with rough handling or teasing. If you want a dog who... A Scottish Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Scottish Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

Sealyham Terriers," The AKC Standard says, ""The Sealyham Terrier should be the embodiment of power and determination, ever keen and alert, of extraordinary substance."" Though not as boisterous as some terriers, the Sealyham is more independent and more self-willed. One of the few terriers who is calm, relaxed, and undemanding indoors (though he can play the entertaining clown), the Sealyham Terrier does need his walks and an occasional romp -- but only in a safe, enclosed area, for he has strong hunting instincts and will pursue whatever runs. He is devoted to his family, aloof with strangers, and can be scrappy with other animals. His great stubbornness calls for early obedience training, but use food and praise methods and don't jerk this proud breed around. Physical punishment doesn't work with terriers, only leading to greater obstinacy and/or retaliation. Teasing will produce the same results. Demonstrating consistent leadership so that a Sealy respects your decisions is more important than advanced obedience exercises. Possessiveness of food and toys is a potential behavioral trait that must be nipped in the bud. Sealys are powerful diggers with a surprisingly deep bark. If you want a dog who... A Sealyham Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Sealyham Terrier may not be right for you.

Shetland Sheepdogs," Proud and animated, the Shetland Sheepdog is a swift, light-footed runner and an agile, graceful jumper. Don't be fooled by his size – this breed has the heritage of an active herding dog and needs more exercise than many other smallish dogs. More importantly, Shelties need ""mental exercise."" These bright dogs cannot just sit in the backyard and do nothing. To be happy and well-behaved, they require mental stimulation such as advanced obedience, agility, herding, or challenging games you play with them, even if it's just fetching balls and finding hidden toys. Exceptionally attentive and responsive, Shetland Sheepdogs are easy to train if you have a calm voice and a light hand on the leash. Sensitivity is one of the hallmarks of this breed. Often they need only verbal corrections, and they wilt or become defensive if you jerk them around. Praise, gentle guidance with your hands or leash, and food rewards are the way to go with Shelties. These dogs have quick reflexes, which can make them overly reactive to loud noises and sudden touches. Indeed, quite a few individuals are highstrung, startle easily, and do not do well in an environment with frequent tension, loud voices, or too much rough-housing. They can be overwhelmed by the herky-jerky mannerisms of small children. Most Shelties have a soft, sweet temperament. They're peaceful with other animals and polite with everyone, though typically reserved and sometimes timid with strangers. To build a confident temperament, the Shetland Sheepdog needs more extensive socialization than many other breeds. Shelties become unhappy when left for long periods of time without companionship, and unhappiness can translate to neurotic behaviors, destructive chewing, or chronic barking. The major behavioral issue with Shelties, in fact, is excessive barking, and some individuals have high-pitched, piercing voices. If you want a dog who... A Shetland Sheepdog may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Shetland Sheepdog may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Sheltie If I was considering a Shetland Sheepdog, I would be most concerned about... The intelligence and enthusiasm of this breed is wasted in most households. You should get your Sheltie involved in advanced obedience classes at a local dog club, and also in agility classes (obstacle course). I don't recommend most Shetland Sheepdogs for homes with young children. Shelties often feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that young children can't help making."
Shiba Inus," People often find themselves drawn to the Shiba Inu because he is conveniently sized, handsome and hardy, easy to groom, and clean and quiet indoors. However.... these potential owners should explore this breed in more depth, else they might be making a big mistake. The Shiba Inu, you see, is very challenging to raise and train. A bold, high-spirited ""big dog in a small body,"" he must always be kept on-leash, for he has a high prey drive and quick reflexes and will pursue anything that moves. He can outrun and outdodge any human.... and frequently does, for he has an independent spirit. Shibas are true runners. Shiba Inu owners need secure fences. Indeed, if you plan of leaving your Shiba outdoors unsupervised, he really should have a covered run (as in chainlink all across the top) if you want to be sure of finding him in the yard where you left him. Otherwise, his ingenuity and agile jumping/climbing/digging skills may send him over or under an ordinary fence. And once he's loose, he's gone. Dog aggression is a common breed trait. Cats are iffy around many Shibas, and small caged pets will be stalked and probably dispatched with. You must stay one step ahead of the Shiba Inu, for he is both dominant and clever. He often tries to manipulate through intimidation and when displeased by something can emit a loud scream which may catch you (or your vet) totally unprepared. With his marked stubborn streak and mischievous sense of humor, the Shiba Inu does best with owners who are firm, confident, and utterly consistent. Shibas are possessive of their toys and food; it is said that if they could utter one word, it would be ""Mine!"" If you want a dog who... A Shiba Inu may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Shiba Inu may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

Shih Tzus," Carrying himself with a proud, arrogant bearing, yet possessing a happy, sweet-natured temperament, the Shih Tzu is less demanding and less yappy than most other toy breeds. Though he is solidly built and lively and loves to play in the yard, he doesn't need much more exercise than that. A lover of comfort and attention, he enjoys cuddling on laps and snuggling into soft pillows. He makes a terrific pet for senior citizens. Most Shih Tzus are friendly (or at least polite) with strangers, though socialization is necessary to develop this trusting temperament. Shih Tzus are also peaceful with other pets. Though he has an aristocratic demeanor, a stubborn streak, and definite likes and dislikes, the Shih Tzu doesn't tend to get into much trouble, and even when he doesn't obey very quickly, he's easy to forgive. Training will actually go very well if you rely on consistency, praise, and food rewards. The most difficult thing to teach a Shih Tzu is housebreaking. If you want a dog who... A Shih Tzu may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Shih Tzu may not be right for you.

Shiloh Shepherds," The Shiloh Shepherd was developed in the 1960s by crossing German Shepherd lines with a few other breeds. Compared to German Shepherds, Shiloh Shepherds are larger and tend to have calmer, softer, more easygoing personalities. Also they often have longer coats that require more grooming. Though they need long, brisk, daily walks and occasional romping to stay fit, Shiloh Shepherds are known for stamina rather than a high energy level. One breeder calls them ""slow but steady."" Most Shiloh Shepherds are intelligent, trainable dogs. They enjoy swimming, carrying backpacks, and pulling carts or sleds. Some have even been used in Search & Rescue. If you want a dog who... A Shiloh Shepherd may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Shiloh Shepherd may not be right for you.

Siberian Huskies," The AKC Standard says the Siberian Husky ""does not display the possessive qualities of the guard dog, nor is he overly suspicious of strangers or aggressive with other dogs."" Indeed, the free-spirited Siberian Husky is usually good-natured with everyone. He is playful, athletic, agile, and light on his feet. He loves the great outdoors and requires vigorous exercise, especially in cool weather. He should be taken running, hiking, and/or biking every day, always on-leash, for he is independent and born to run. If something catches his interest and he is off-leash, he'll be gone. Teaching him to pull carts and sleds gives him a purpose in life. Without such exercise, mental activity, and lots of companionship, he can be incredibly, massively destructive. Most Siberian Huskies are sociable with other dogs, but he has a very high prey drive and may destroy cats if not raised with them. Siberians should not be kept around rabbits, ferrets, or birds. Fencing must be high and secure, for he can be an escape artist, and once loose, he may run deer and molest livestock. Training is a challenge because the strong-willed Siberian Husky is inclined to use his intelligence in clever ways that suit his own purposes. Digging and howling are favorite pastimes. If you want a dog who... A Siberian Husky may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Siberian Husky may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

Without regular opportunities to vent their energy, or when left alone all day, Siberian Huskies become rambunctious and bored – which they express by howling and destructive chewing. Bored Siberian Huskies are famous for chewing through drywall, ripping the stuffing out of sofas, and turning your yard into a moonscape of giant craters. In other words, you must teach your Siberian Husky to respect you. A dog who respects you will do what you say and will stop what he's doing when you tell him ""No."" Read more about Siberian Husky Training."
Silky Terriers," The Silky Terrier combines the hardiness of the short-legged terriers with a finer-boned, more graceful, more elegant build and lovely coat. (Although I recommend trimming the coat shorter for easier maintenance.) The agile, light-footed Silky likes to keep busy. He is inquisitive, physically and mentally quick, and spends much time trotting (or dashing) around checking things out and inventing his own clever games. Keen of eye and sharp of tongue, the Silky Terrier won't fail to announce strangers, often in a high-pitched voice that can set your teeth on edge. Early socialization is required so he doesn't become too sharp or suspicious. Though he can be bossy with other dogs and scrappy with those of the same sex, most Silky Terriers are willing to coexist with other pets. Squeaky pets, however, will be stalked, for he has a strong prey drive and can be an excitable chaser of anything that moves. Silky Terrier must never be let off-leash except in a safe, enclosed area, and your fences must be secure, for they are amazing climbers and enthusiastic diggers. Willful and opinionated, but quick to learn, the Silky Terrier responds well to obedience training that utilizes food and praise. Silkys are proud, sensitive dogs and may not put up with rough handling or mischief. They can be possessive of their food and toys, and housebreaking can be difficult. If you want a dog who... A Silky Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Silky Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Silky Terrier If I was considering a Silky Terrier, I would be most concerned about... I do not recommend Silky Terriers for homes with small children. Many Silkys will not tolerate any nonsense from little life forms whom they consider to be below themselves in importance. They can be quick to react to teasing, and even to the normal clumsiness that comes with small children (accidental squeezing of their ears or pulling of whiskers or stepping on their paw). In other words, you must teach your Silky Terrier to respect you. A dog who respects you will do what you say and will stop what he's doing when you tell him ""No."" Read more about Silky Terrier Training."
Skye Terriers," The Skye Terrier is more serious, more dignified, and more introspective than most terriers. Though stylish, he is also heavier and more powerful than you might imagine from just seeing a photo. One of the few terriers who is laid-back indoors, the Skye Terrier is easy to exercise, requiring only walks and play sessions. However, he is a fearless, agile chaser with lightning reflexes and should never be let-off leash unless in a safe, enclosed area. Intensely loyal to his family (sometimes attaching himself to one person), the Skye Terrier needs a lot of personal attention -- he cannot be ignored. Skye Terriers are cautious with strangers and should be extensively socialized when young so their wariness does not become suspicion. They are dominant with other dogs and should not be trusted around smaller animals such as cats, rabbits, and rodents. Likewise, the Skye Terrier can be dominant with family members who are wishy-washy. Skyes have great depth of character and prefer to make their own decisions, but they will respect an owner with an equally strong character and a firm voice who knows how to lead a proud, strong-minded dog. Skyes do not suffer fools gladly. They are highly sensitive to correction and likely to retaliate if handled harshly or teased. If you want a dog who... A Skye Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Skye Terrier may not be right for you.

Sloughis," Possessed of a noble, melancholic expression, this elegant, graceful aristocrat is known for his quiet dignity and loyalty. The Sloughi bonds closely (in a subtle way) with his owner and doesn't change that allegiance easily. Aloof and cautious with strangers, he tends to hang back to observe and to avoid being touched. However, he is more territorial than most sighthounds. Some Sloughis should not be taken lightly if truly threatened. Indoors, he is a creature of comfort who prefers soft beds on which he can lounge and survey his domain. However, this composure assumes that he has had a good daily run, for he is a consummate athlete who needs a good deal of exercise. You'll need a large fenced area -- and Sloughis are agile jumpers, so fences should be six feet high -- because he is too fast to be allowed off-leash. Another reason for leashes and fences is his deeply ingrained chasing instinct, which is triggered by the slightest movement, such as leaves blowing or little creatures scurrying. Sloughis are independent thinkers who need firm boundaries or they will take advantage, but they are very sensitive to correction. Train calmly, and coax with food and games. A verbal correction is more effective than a physical one. Many sighthounds are touch-sensitive, startling when touched unexpectedly and uncomfortable when cuddled excessively. If you want a dog who... A Sloughi may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Sloughi may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Sloughi If I was considering a Sloughi, I would be most concerned about... Sloughis need access to a large fenced area – fenced because these independent dogs are likely to take off and not come back. If there is a dog club in your area, get your Sloughi involved in lure coursing (chasing a mechanized lure around a track or across an open field). This is an appropriate outlet for the full-speed galloping behaviors that are ""hardwired"" into his genes. In other words, you must teach your Sloughi to respect you.

Soft-Coated Wheaten Terriers," More congenial than most terriers, the Soft Coated Wheaten is cheerful, lively, and very sociable.....which means he needs a lot of daily companionship. Work all day? Don't get a Wheaten. Wheatens are also known for their high energy – they play hard and vigorously and are renowned ""bouncers"" who jump up and down in attempts to lick your face. It sounds cute, but it can definitely get out of hand! The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier often acts like a joyful puppy throughout his life. Though he will bark to announce strangers, he welcomes them as long-lost friends, usually with exuberant barking, bouncing, and face kissing. Early socialization is mandatory to develop this outgoing attitude, however. And training is necessary to control it! Indeed, this vigorous jumping can be very difficult to stop – it is one of the chief behavior issues of the breed. Fences should be high and secure, as this breed is exploratory and athletic and may jump over to greet people on the other side, or to chase passing cats or squirrels. There is some aggression with other dogs of the same sex; otherwise the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is usually gregarious with other family pets. Bright and sensitive, yet spunky and headstrong, the Soft Coated Wheaten, like most terriers, is not particularly easy to train. He requires a leash at all times, else he will take off on you, and he requires an assertive owner who can set consistent rules and follow through. If you want a dog who... A Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier If I was considering a Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier, I would be most concerned about... Another reason I do not recommend Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers for small children is their general terrier ""pride."" Wheatens can be great fun for teenagers, but many individuals will not tolerate any nonsense and are quick to react to teasing and even to the normal clumsiness that comes with small children (accidental squeezing of their ears or pulling of whiskers or stepping on their paw). Many terriers are possessive of their food and toys and will defend these from all comers, including children. Remember that terriers cannot be trusted off-leash. They will take off, oblivious to your frantic shouts, after anything that runs. In other words, you must teach your Wheaten Terrier to respect you. A dog who respects you will do what you say and will stop what he's doing when you tell him ""No."" Read more about Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Training."
Staffordshire Bull Terriers," The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is rugged, energetic, and impulsive. ""Why walk when you can run and play games?"" is his motto. He requires rigorous exercise as an outlet for his energy and to maintain his splendid muscle tone. The people-oriented Stafford craves companionship and wants to be with you all the time. With proper socialization, he is friendly with everyone, yet makes a sensible watchdog. Most Staffordshire Bull Terriers will live peacefully with the dogs and cats in their own family. But many Staffords are more than willing to fight if challenged. Before bringing a Staffordshire Bull Terrier into a multi-pet household, you should honestly evaluate your other pets. If you already have a dominant dog, a Stafford is not a good choice for you. Staffords should be closely supervised around strange dogs – make sure the other dogs are not challenging yours. Stubborn and sometimes headstrong, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier is inclined to test for position in the family pecking order. Confident leadership and obedience training are musts. Provide the strongest chew toys you can find to keep his powerful jaws busy and as an alternative to furniture. The athletic Stafford can scale a six-foot fence, and when inclined, he can dig his way under. This ""buff little dude"" is a stable, confident dog who needs supervision and control from an owner who can match his intelligence. If you want a dog who... A Staffordshire Bull Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Staffordshire Bull Terrier may not be right for you.

Standard Schnauzers," The AKC Standard says of the Standard Schnauzer, ""His nature combines high-spirited temperament with extreme reliability."" The Standard Schnauzer's keen expression is what you may notice first. Some are ""harder tempered,"" projecting boldness, seriousness, and vigor, while others are sweeter and more mellow. Lively indoors and out, the agile, athletic Standard Schnauzer loves to play games and needs brisk walking every day and a chance to run several times per week. Mental exercise (such as advanced obedience or agility) will satisfy his highly developed intelligence. Without structured activities, he will find his own amusements -- and his choices may change the appearance of your house or yard. Most Standard Schnauzers are aloof with strangers, but with proper socialization are sensible and discriminating about who is a friend and who is not. Many Standard Schnauzers are aggressive with other dogs of the same sex. One of the smartest of all breeds, and one of the best problem-solvers, the Standard Schnauzer is clever, strong-willed, and persistent. Unless you establish yourself as the alpha (number one), he can be demanding. Yet owners who know how to lead and who use upbeat training methods will find him eminently trainable. This sensitive dog seems always aware of your moods and likes to be physically close to you and watching you.  If you want a dog who... A Standard Schnauzer may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Standard Schnauzer may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

Sussex Spaniels," Matching his somber, almost frowning expression, the Sussex Spaniel is calmer and steadier than most other spaniels, though he does conceal a dry sense of humor. This long, low, heavyset dog is rather phlegmatic indoors, but loves the outdoors and will bound through the fields in search of lurking creatures. The Sussex Spaniel is aloof with strangers and sometimes even protective (very unusual for a spaniel). But once guests are accepted, he becomes polite, even charming -- as long as he has been well-socialized. Sussex Spaniels can also be pushy with strange dogs (again, unusual for a spaniel). His tendencies toward dominance and stubbornness require a consistent owner who knows how to lead and who will use positive, upbeat training methods. This proud dog will stand up for himself if handled sharply or teased. Finally, the Sussex Spaniel is noted for being one of the most vocal of the spaniels, tending to bark and howl, especially if left alone too much. And he can be slow to housebreak. If you want a dog who... A Sussex Spaniel may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Sussex Spaniel may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

Swedish Vallhunds,"Molly, dearly loved by the Polglase family. Photo © Tony Polglase. The FCI Standard calls the Swedish Vallhund ""watchful, alert, and energetic."" Vallhund  is Swedish for shepherd dog. Yes, despite his short legs, this breed is a herding dog and his spunkiness and intelligence prove it. Spirited and athletic, yet steady and dependable, the Swedish Vallhund is a true ""big dog with short legs."" Hiking, herding, obedience, agility, or chasing balls (with surprising speed) are enjoyable outlets for the Vallhund's enthusiasm and desire to work. Swedish Vallhunds love to be challenged with new tasks. If his days include such moderate exercise, along with the loving companionship of his family, he is adaptable and easy to live with. Badger.... happy smile! Beloved companion of the Polglase family. Photo © Tony Polglase. Most Swedish Vallhunds are friendly (or at least polite) with everyone and make sensible watchdogs. Most are fine with other animals and especially wonderful with livestock, including horses. This attentive breed learns quickly and responds well to obedience training, but he does combine the independent judgment of a herding breed with the persistent, sometimes manipulative nature of the spitz family. You must have the confidence to establish and consistently enforce rules, or he may make up his own. Swedish Vallhunds prefer their flock (family members and other pets) to be gathered together and may try to accomplish this by poking or nipping. Barking is the main behavior issue to control. If you want a dog who... A Swedish Vallhund may be right for you.  If you don't want to deal with... A Swedish Vallhund may not be right for you.

I recommend that you get your Swedish Vallhund involved in obedience classes at the intermediate or advanced level, agility (an obstacle course for dogs), tracking, or herding. Otherwise, trying to suppress their ""hardwired"" working instincts, without providing alternate outlets for their energy, can be difficult and is really not fair to the dog. In other words, you must teach your Swedish Vallhund to respect you. A dog who respects you will do what you say and will stop what he's doing when you tell him ""No."" Read more about Swedish Vallhund Training."
Tibetan Mastiffs," This powerful, rugged breed with the solemn expression is not inclined to play fetch or frisbee or frolic in the yard with you. Indeed, the Tibetan Mastiff was developed strictly for working purposes, and his instincts to perform that work are ingrained. Livestock guardians bond with flock animals, as well as their own families, with fierce possessiveness, making their own decisions about who is a friend and who is a foe, what is a threat and what is not. In other words, these strong-willed, self-reliant dogs will attempt to take control of every situation unless you are an assertive leader who demands respect. The Tibetan Mastiff is serious and dignified, calm and quiet -- unless provoked. Aloof with strangers, he will remain watchful every moment they are on his property. This breed is typically patient with his own children and other family pets, but requires careful introduction to those outside the family. The Tibetan Mastiff often prefers to be outdoors where he can view and patrol his territory. However, despite his bulk, this breed is remarkably agile, skilled at climbing and jumping, and requires a six-foot-high fence. Tibetan Mastiffs also have a deep, impressive bark which they tend to use freely, especially at night when they are most attentive. And they sometimes dig deep holes to lie in. All in all, most Tibetan Mastiffs are ""too much dog"" for the average household. Very few people really have the facilities or skills necessary to manage this breed and keep him happy.

Since you have to minimize their exercise, young Tibetan Mastiffs can be very rambunctious. They will romp with uncoordinated gawkiness all over your house. You need to substitute extra quantities of companionship and supervision. Otherwise, left alone, young Tibetan Mastiffs become bored and destructive. In other words, you must teach your Tibetan Mastiff to respect you. A dog who respects you will do what you say and will stop what he's doing when you tell him ""No."" Read more about Tibetan Mastiff Training."
Tibetan Spaniels," With his independent nature and quick agility, the Tibetan Spaniel has been compared to a cat. Lively and playful, yet also calm and laid-back, this good-natured dog is easy to live with. He fits into an apartment or an estate with equal contentment. All he asks for in the way of exercise are daily walks and occasional romps in a safe enclosed area. Tibetan Spaniels are family-oriented: they love to play games with their own people, are sensitive to moods and feelings, and do not like to be left alone for long periods of time. They are agile, sure-footed climbers (can often be found perched on the windowsill or the high back of a chair, looking out the window) and clever problem-solvers who often rely on their dexterity to get what they want. For example, they will use their paws to pry open a cabinet door. Most Tibetan Spaniels are conservative with strangers and don't like being swooped down on by people they don't know. Early socialization is important to develop a confident, outgoing temperament. Most are friendly with other animals. Though stubborn and self-reliant, the Tibetan Spaniel is also sensitive; obedience training should utilize food and praise. If you want a dog who... A Tibetan Spaniel may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Tibetan Spaniel may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

Tibetan Terriers," The good-natured Tibetan Terrier is lively and playful, yet also calm and low-key. He is a moderate dog in all respects and can adapt to any home, city or country, so long as he is given brisk daily walks and occasional romps in a safe enclosed area. He especially enjoys playing in the snow, his large, flat, snowshoe-like feet providing traction, and his long heavy eyelashes protecting his eyes. He is athletic and agile, a sure-footed climber, and a clever problem-solver who often uses his paws with great adeptness to open doors and hold toys. Tibetan Terriers are family-oriented: they love to play games and participate in activities with their own people, but most are conservative with strangers. In some individuals, caution can shade into timidity or suspiciousness, so early socialization is important to develop a confident, outgoing temperament. Most are amiable with other animals, though perhaps a bit bossy. Indeed, the Tibetan Terrier is very stubborn in general and must be shown from Day One that you are in control. If you want a dog who... A Tibetan Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Tibetan Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

A long coat means much more brushing and messiness, but less hair on your furniture, while a shorter coat means much less brushing and matting and tracked-in debris, but a few more shed hairs on your furniture."
Tosa Inu," The Tosa Inu (inu  just means dog in Japanese) was developed to be a massive dog-fighting machine. It should be no surprise, then, that animal aggression is a serious issue. I would never keep a Tosa with another dog of the same sex. Frankly, I wouldn't keep one with another dog at all. No cats, either. Tosas can display predatory behavior toward cats. And small dogs. Any animal that runs, really. This is not a dog for a farm with livestock. Now, a Tosa Inu is not supposed to be aggressive towards people. And yet the athleticism and agility of this breed, combined with his immense power, mean that he must be well bred, well socialized, well trained, and under control at all times. The Tosa is often described as being ""stately, quiet, calm, and relaxed, until aroused."" Now, you probably picture that as meaning a bad guy rushing at your family. And it could mean that. But it could also mean a neighbor's child rushing toward your child to play. When you own a breed like a Tosa, your legal and ethical responsibilities are enormous. Erect high solid board fences all around your property. Never leave a Tosa in the yard unsupervised. Never let a Tosa off-leash in public. Have plenty of personal liability insurance, assuming an insurance company will even give it to you. Honestly, there are very few people who need or should want a Tosa. Maybe if you want a dog to participate in the sport of weight pulling. Tosas excel at this, with some Tosas pulling more than 3000 pounds. But how many people can handle a dog who can pull more than 3000 pounds? Physically, of course, the answer is, ""No one."" This breed cannot be outmuscled. That means he needs to be convinced – psychologically – to respect you, which in turn means you need to be an experienced and confident person who thoroughly understands how to elevate yourself above a dog in the family pecking order. With this dominant, self-willed breed, anything less is just asking for trouble. And it won't be a question of ""if"" but ""when."" Couple more things.... Serious health problems. The life span of an Tosa Inu is short – about 10 years. An alarming number are crippled by bone and joint diseases and/or succumb to cancer in middle age. Legal liabilities. The Tosa is banned or restricted in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, and others. In the United States, insurance companies may cancel your homeowner's policy. Your friends and neighbors may be uncomfortable around this breed. In this day and age, the legal liabilities of owning a giant breed that looks intimidating and has a dog-fighting history should be considered. People are quicker to sue if such a dog does anything even remotely questionable. In summary, the Tosa Inu is ""far too much dog"" for the average household."
Toy Fox Terriers," Bold and determined for his size, the spunky Toy Fox Terrier can be intensely focused and impulsive, but is more biddable and amenable than his larger cousin, the Smooth Fox Terrier. Both terrier and toy traits influence his personality and character. As a terrier, he is alert, proud, and spunky. As a toy, he is of quieter demeanor and loves to be held. Many Toy Fox Terriers dearly love to play ball and do a fine job of exercising themselves indoors, but they are well balanced in rest and play time. The Toy Fox Terrier is comical and entertaining and remains so throughout his long life. With his curiosity, quickness, and chasing instincts, he must always be leashed or fenced outdoors. Securely fenced, because he likes to explore -- and that means the other side of the fence, whether he has to climb over, dig under, or squeeze through the cracks. With his keen eyesight and acute hearing, the Toy Fox Terrier is quick to announce strangers with his sharp, suspicious bark. This breed is described as ""not easily intimidated by other animals,"" which means that not only will he not back down if challenged, but also that he may do much of the challenging himself! However, he does tend to get along well with other pets within the family. Toy Fox Terriers have an independent mind and a mischievous sense of humor and prefer learning tricks to formal obedience exercises. But they are quite trainable when praise and treats are the primary motivators. Housebreaking, though, can be difficult, especially in cold or rainy weather. If you want a dog who... A Toy Fox Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Toy Fox Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Toy Fox Terrier If I was considering a Toy Fox Terrier, I would be most concerned about... I don't recommend Toy Fox Terriers for homes with young children. Children cannot help being clumsy, and that a child meant well is little solace to a Toy Fox Terrier puppy who has been accidentally stepped on, sat on, rolled on, squeezed, or dropped onto the patio. Even Toy Fox Terrier adults may feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making, and stress and shyness (even defensive biting) may be the result. Finally, some Toy Fox Terriers do not tolerate any nonsense and are quick to react to teasing or rough handling, whether deliberate or accidental. In other words, you must teach your Toy Fox Terrier to respect you. A dog who respects you will do what you say and will stop what he's doing when you tell him ""No."" Read more about Toy Fox Terrier Training."
Transylvanian Griffinfinch," The Transylvanian Griffinfinch (pronounced transylvanian griffinfinch) is a bizarre dog breed, somewhat frustrating to live with. In this review, we'll look at the unique behaviors of this breed, along with the health problems. If you want a dog who... A Transylvanian Griffinfinch may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Transylvanian Griffinfinch may not be right for you. Good. All the more for the rest of us! If I were considering buying or adopting a Transylvanian Griffinfinch I would be most concerned about... First, you should print your Griffinfinch on durable paper, not cheapo photocopy paper. Second, to keep your Griffinfinch healthy, the most important things to remember are: Griffinfinches should NOT be handed over to children. That a child ""meant well"" is little solace to a Griffinfinch who has been folded into a paper airplane and launched skyward. Even worse is the poor little Griffinfinch who is folded into an Origami flower. Remember that Griffinfinches do not come when called. Ever. So if yours gets too far away, you'll have to give chase. If you've ""had it up to here"" chasing your Griffinfinch on windy days, you might consider a radical surgical procedure involving a hole punch and a length of string. Needless to say, this should only be carried out under general anesthesia. A less-drastic solution for a wandering Griffinfinch is to tape him to a sheet of heavy cardboard. Unfortunately, this will cut down on his ability to exercise, so he may become lethargic. When looking for a missing Griffinfinch, check under the furniture. They like to hide – sometimes because they're manipulative, sometimes because they're shy. If you have a shy Griffinfinch, he is more likely to feel secure and stay put if you tuck him inside a manila file folder when set him down. Alas, some Griffinfinches will NEVER stay where you put them. You may need to ""get tough"" with stubborn Griffinfinches by weighing them down with a paperweight or attaching them to a clipboard. You can try using a paperclip – attaching the Griffinfinch to other sheets of paper – but a really determined Griffinfinch will simply take the other papers with him. If you find a whole pile of papers hiding under the furniture, and a Griffinfinch is attached to them, don't punish the other papers. Undoubtedly it was the Griffinfinch who masterminded the whole thing. The other papers simply ""went along for the ride."" Your Griffinfinch does not require trimming or clipping unless he has excessive white space around him. If you make a mistake when trimming your Griffinfinch, you can try to fix it with tape or glue, but everyone will be able to tell that you messed it up and they will snicker at your Griffinfinch behind your back. You can lengthen your Griffinfinch's life by slipping him into a clear plastic sleeve, but it may not be much of a life. Think of your poor Griffinfinch peering at the world through a plastic sheet that obscures his vision and hearing and scenting ability. Please don't have your Griffinfinch laminated. Really, what good is it to have a dog who can't breathe?"
Vizslas," The AKC Standard calls the Vizsla ""lively, gentle-mannered, demonstrably affectionate, and sensitive."" The good-natured Vizsla has also been called a ""Velcro"" dog because he is so tactile -- he likes to attach himself to people, preferably in their laps. Athletic, agile, and light on his feet, the Vizsla is a robust hunting dog who needs vigorous daily exercise and lots of personal attention. Too much confinement and too little companionship can lead to neurotic behaviors such as hyperactivity and destructiveness. Bored Vizslas are notorious chewers. Most Vizslas get along well with everyone, including strangers and other animals, but they do need a lot of early socialization to build confidence. Some Vizslas are excitable and/or easily startled in new situations. The Vizsla has the independent spirit of all pointing breeds, but responds to training more willingly than most and is a capable performer in advanced obedience competition. You may need to control his tendency to mouth your hands -- provide a box filled with toys so he can carry things around in his mouth. If you want a dog who... A Vizsla may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Vizsla may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Vizsla If I was considering a Vizsla, I would be most concerned about... If you simply want a pet for your family, and don't have the time or inclination to take your dog running or hiking or biking or swimming, or to get involved in hunting, or agility (obstacle course) classes, or advanced obedience, I do not recommend this breed (unless you adopt an older adult with a mellow temperament)."
Weimaraners," The high-energy Weimaraner, bred to hunt all day, needs an athletic owner who can meet his demanding exercise needs: running, biking, hiking, jogging, field work. Too much confinement leads to hyperactivity and destructiveness, as does being left alone too much. A bored Weimaraner will bark up a storm, demolish your home and yard, even attempt to escape in search of adventure. Reserved with strangers, dominant with other dogs, predatory toward small animals such as cats and rabbits, most Weimaraners need an owner who can provide leadership, socialization, and training beyond the beginner level. Though this breed is headstrong, in the right hands he is capable of learning and doing virtually anything. Indeed, a well-matched owner will find the Weimaraner a loyal, aristocratic gentleman of great presence and character. A novice with little time and space will find him a rambunctious bully, difficult to control. If you want a dog who... A Weimaraner may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Weimaraner may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Weimaraner If I was considering a Weimaraner, I would be most concerned about...

You must teach your Weimaraner to respect you. A dog who respects you will do what you say and will stop what he's doing when you tell him ""No."" Read more about Weimaraner Training."
Welsh Springer Spaniels," The Welsh Springer Spaniel is steadier, more sensible, and less exuberant than his cousin, the Welsh Springer. A hardy, vigorous worker in the field, the Welsh Springer Spaniel loves the outdoors and needs as much running, hiking, or biking exercise as you can provide. Indoors he attaches himself with great devotion to his people. He is reserved with strangers, sometimes reticent, so he needs to be accustomed to people and noises at an early age. With other animals, he is peaceful and dependable. Because of his independence and tendency to be easily distracted, the Welsh Springer Spaniel requires early training so that good habits are instilled right from the start. However, he is physically and emotionally sensitive and ""soft,"" so training should be done with a calm voice and a light hand on the leash. These gentle dogs wilt under rough handling. Submissive urination (sudden wetting when excited or anxious) can be a problem in youngsters. If you want a dog who... A Welsh Springer Spaniel may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Welsh Springer Spaniel may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

Welsh Terriers," The compact Welsh Terrier, who looks like a miniature Airedale, is steadier, more sensible, and less excitable than some terriers, yet still full of energy and drive. The more exercise you can offer, the better. Always alert and ready for a game, his inquisitiveness and tenacity can get him into tight spots (literally) unless your fences are secure and/or he is well supervised. The Welsh Terrier does best with active owners who are confident and consistent, for he has a marked independent streak and will take advantage if indulged. Welsh Terriers are more amiable with other dogs than some terriers, but they won't back down if challenged. They have a high prey drive, which means little creatures (often including cats) will be stalked. Most Welsh Terriers are friendly and outgoing with everyone, though proper socialization is important to develop this self-confidence. The alert Welsh Terrier can be counted on to sound the alert when anything is amiss; in fact, excessive barking may need to be controlled. True terriers, they love to tunnel and dig and can be possessive of their food and toys. If you want a dog who... A Welsh Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Welsh Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Welsh Terrier If I was considering a Welsh Terrier, I would be most concerned about... Terriers should not be trusted off-leash. They will take off, oblivious to your frantic shouts, after anything that runs. To teach your Welsh Terrier to listen to you, ""Respect Training"" is mandatory. Read more about Welsh Terrier Training."
West Highland White Terriers," The AKC Standard says that the West Highland White Terrier (Westie) is ""possessed with no small amount of self-esteem."" Indeed! Along with the Cairn Terrier (""Toto"" from the Wizard of Oz), the West Highland White Terrier is what many people picture when they hear ""terrier."" The Westie is everything a terrier was designed to be. Sturdy, spunky, and bold, he needs his daily walks and interactive play sessions.  Yet he is easier to handle and friendlier than some other terriers. He can adapt to any home in which he can be a full participant and busybody. Quick to announce anything amiss, including visitors, the Westie usually proceeds to welcome them inside with a gaily wagging tail. West Highland White Terriers can be bossy with other dogs of the same sex, but otherwise coexist with other dogs and cats more readily than most terriers. Rabbits and rodents, however, are in for a stressful (and probably short) life, along with wild critters who venture into the Westie's yard. He will pursue with tenacity anything that moves and cannot be let off-leash except in a safe, enclosed area. Assertive but cheerful, with the typical stubbornness and cleverness of a true terrier, the Westie must be shown that you are in charge, else he may become demanding and testy when he doesn't get his own way. He does respond well to consistent discipline and to obedience training that utilizes food rewards. West Highland White Terriers can be possessive of their food and toys, and they are determined diggers and barkers. If you want a dog who... A West Highland White Terrier may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A West Highland White Terrier may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding.

Whippets," The AKC Standard says the Whippet is ""amiable, friendly, gentle, but capable of great intensity during sporting pursuits."" The Whippet, of course, looks like a small Greyhound. Both breeds are members of the sighthound  family, which hunts prey animals (rats, rabbits, etc.) by spotting movement and running the unfortunate animal down blazing speed. The Whippet is sweet-natured and docile, yet playful and athletic. The same dog who will curl up under the blankets – a perfect couch potato, sleeping for hours – will tear enthusiastically around the yard, darting and zigzagging and turning on a dime without slowing down. Whippets love running games and require short bursts of vigorous exercise each day. The area must be fenced, for this racy breed is the fastest dog of his weight: he can run up to 35 mph. Whippet puppies can be mischievous and destructive, but adults are calm, undemanding, and unobtrusive indoors, trotting around with a light-footed easy grace and seldom making a peep. They do insist on the luxury of being up on the furniture, so if this offends you, you shouldn't consider a sighthound. Polite with strangers, the Whippet should be accustomed to people and noises at an early age. He is peaceful with other dogs but has a high prey drive and cannot be trusted with smaller pets. Whippets are mildly stubborn, but also very sensitive. They respond favorably only to calm, upbeat training methods that emphasize praise and food. Most sighthounds tend to be touch-sensitive, tending to startle a bit when touched unexpectedly or grabbed for a hug. If you want a dog who... A Whippet may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Whippet may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Whippet If I was considering a Whippet, I would be most concerned about... See if there is a dog club in your area that offers an activity called lure coursing, which is chasing a mechanical lure in a controlled setting. This is an appropriate outlet for the full-speed galloping behaviors that are ""hardwired"" into your Whippet's genes. Should you consider a Whippet if you have young children? It depends on the individual dog and the individual children. These sensitive dogs often feel overwhelmed by the loud voices and quick movements that children can't help making – and stress and shyness may be the result. Personally I think that the sighthound breeds do best in homes without young children."
White Shepherds," There are really three  dog breeds that could claim the name White Shepherd. The very popular breed that we call a German Shepherd comes in a variety of colors, including white. For several reasons (not necessarily good  reasons), white dogs aren't appreciated by the German Shepherd's national breed club nor by German Shepherd breeders who compete at dog shows. Despite their disapproval, a white puppy who pops up in a litter of German Shepherds can still be registered with the American Kennel Club as a German Shepherd. So if you're considering acquiring an AKC-registered German Shepherd who just happens to be white, you can expect a similar temperament and behavior as if he were a more familiar black and tan color. In the United States, instead of registering a white German Shepherd puppy with the American Kennel Club, you might choose to register him with a different association called the United  Kennel Club. The UKC offers separate registration to white dogs under their own breed name: White Shepherd. If you're considering acquiring a UKC-registered White Shepherd, you need to find out whether the breeder's goal was to make the temperament of his dogs the same as (or different from) normal-colored German Shepherds. White Shepherds are often bred to have a softer, more mellow, more sensitive personality. Because of this sweeter temperament, White Shepherds are seldom used as police dogs, guard dogs, or to participate in protection dog sports such as schutzhund. A White Shepherd can certainly be a very good watchdog, but his ""watching"" is usually limited to alerting you that someone is coming. White Shepherds are not typically aggressive. In fact, if a White Shepherd is going to have any temperament fault, it's more likely to be timidity or skittishness. White Shepherds need a great deal of early socialization to build a confident attitude toward strangers and strange situations. White Shepherds do need plenty of physical and mental exercise. This smart breed should not be relegated to a home that simply wants a casual pet to walk around the block. White Shepherds can be quite vocal, tending to whine, mumble, and grumble. Though they seldom have dominant personalities, White Shepherds still need a confident, consistent owner who will establish and enforce rules. Finally, there is another breed, based in Europe and registered with an international association called the FCI. This breed is called the White Swiss Shepherd (Berger Blanc Suisse) and it differs from both AKC German Shepherds and UKC White Shepherds in key areas of appearance, temperament, and health. I'm currently working on an article about that breed. If you want a dog who... A White Shepherd may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A White Shepherd may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the White Shepherd If I was considering a White Shepherd, I would be most concerned about... Get your White Shepherd involved in agility (obstacle course), or advanced obedience classes. Play fetch games. Take them hiking. They must have physical outlets for their energy, and mental outlets for their intelligent minds."
Wirehaired Pointing Griffons," This rugged, athletic hunting dog has a pleasant disposition, but vigorous daily exercise (jogging, biking, hiking, field work) is high on his list of Things to Do, as are companionship and personal attention. Too much solitary confinement makes him restless and prone to separation anxiety, which he may express by chewing destructively. With strangers, the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon tends to be politely aloof. To avoid his caution shading into timidity, he should be accustomed to people and noises at an early age. With other animals, he is usually accepting, though some individuals can be cat chasers. The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is independent and easily distracted, but he is not a dominant dog and is quite responsive to obedience training that includes a calm voice and light hand. He can be a little slow to housebreak and some individuals bark excessively, especially without enough exercise or mental stimulation. Be aware that Wirehaired Pointing Griffons, like all whiskery dog breeds, are not for the fastidious household, as they are sloppy drinkers, their beard soaking up water and depositing it as a trail of drips across your floor. If you want a dog who... A Wirehaired Pointing Griffon may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Wirehaired Pointing Griffon may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon If I was considering a Wirehaired Pointing Griffon, I would be most concerned about... Wirehaired Pointing Griffons need regular opportunities to vent their energy and do interesting things. Otherwise they will become restless and bored, which is likely to result in barking and destructive chewing."
Xoloitzcuintli," The elegant Xoloitzcuintli (show-lo-eats-kwint-lee) is also known as the Xolo or Mexican Hairless. He comes in sizes from small to large, but the small ones are most common. This animated breed moves lightly and gracefully, runs swiftly, and jumps and climbs with agility. His webbed toes are somewhat prehensile, allowing him to grip toys with dexterity – or your neck in an affectionate hug. Tranquil in the home, the Xoloitzcuintli is exceptionally attentive to his owner and needs a lot of personal interaction. He is likely to pine or act out when left too long without the companionship of people or other pets. Wary of strangers, the Xoloitzcuintli makes an alert watchdog, exceedingly aware of his surroundings. Some Xolos are high-strung and/or timid of new people and new situations. Early and frequent socialization will help build a confident, stable temperament. Still somewhat primitive in behavior, the Xoloitzcuintli is most content with structure and consistency in his life. He often reacts based on instinct, and his reflexes are lightning fast. Though independent, the Xolo is smart and sensitive and responds best to gentle, reward-based obedience training. Harsh discipline only frightens him. Because of his athleticism and ingenuity, your fences should be high and secure. Don't allow his barking to become established or it will be a tough habit to break. If you want a dog who... A Xoloitzcuintli may be right for you. If you don't want to deal with... A Xoloitzcuintli may not be right for you. Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament is less predictable than the inheritance of physical traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training. More traits and characteristics of the Xoloitzcuintli If I was considering a Xoloitzcuintli, I would be most concerned about... In other words, you must teach your Xolo to respect you. A dog who respects you will do what you say and will stop what he's doing when you tell him ""No."" Read more about Xoloitzcuintli Training."
Yorkshire Terriers (Yorkies),"  Yorkies are bright little dogs who enjoy learning tricks. This lovely girl is clipped in a short coat that looks great and is super easy to maintain. What is a Yorkie? A unique combination of terrier and toy dog. Starting out as a smallish terrier in Scotland, the Yorkie was brought to Yorkshire, England, by Scottish weavers and miniaturized into a true lapdog size. But lapdog doesn't necessarily mean all Yorkies like to sleep on laps all day. Some Yorkshire Terriers are indeed dedicated cuddle-bugs. But others act more like tiny terriers, with instincts to chase anything that moves and warn off strangers with a sharp shrill bark. As a trainer and behavioral consultant, the biggest problems I see with Yorkies have to do with how their owners treat them. If you carry your Yorkie everywhere, you're telling him that you think the world is too terrifying for him to walk around in. Coddling and babying leads to insecure dogs who tremble in your arms and bark when they see a strange sight or hear a strange sound. This isn't a healthy state of mind for any dog to live with. Don't treat your Yorkie like a doll to be carried or cuddled for hours. Do obedience training with him. Build him a tiny obstacle course. Teach him to play fetch with a cherished toy or ball. Above all, make sure he behaves. When treated sensibly, most Yorkies are lively and inquisitive, physically and mentally quick, and spend much time trotting around the house and yard, checking things out. Now, you do need to take precautions! There are indeed dangers lurking everywhere for toy dogs. The trick is to let your Yorkie walk on his own four feet as much as possible, while still keeping an eagle eye out for real danger. If you don't protect his safety, he can be hurt or killed, but if you baby him and don't require him to stand on his own four feet and be well-behaved, he can end up insecure or downright nasty This is NOT a breed to allow off-leash. Too much can happen to these small creatures in the blink of an eye. Larger dogs may view him as a delicacy and he is just brave/foolish enough to charge toward them, bellowing threats in his high-pitched voice. Plus he has excitable chasing instincts and will chase birds and butterflies across the road. If all this sounds like Yorkshire Terriers are too active for your taste, rest assured that even the go-getters are lovers of comfort who enjoys snuggling into soft pillows periodically through the day.   Keep in mind that the inheritance of temperament  is less predictable than the inheritance of physical  traits such as size or shedding. Temperament and behavior are also shaped by raising and training.

But some individuals are smaller, and many are quite a bit larger. Let me ask you: Have you heard of a Teacup Yorkie? a Tiny Toy Yorkie? an Extreme Tiny Yorkie? Those phrases are made-up. There is no such breed or variety as a Teacup Yorkie, Tiny Toy Yorkie, or Extreme Tiny Yorkie. Those are simply cutesy marketing terms that some clever breeders use to try to make you think you're getting some kind of extra-special Yorkshire Terrier. Such a breeder might tell you that ""Toy"" Yorkies are a certain weight range, ""Tiny Toy"" Yorkies are slightly smaller, ""Extreme Tiny"" Yorkies are smaller than that, etc. These breeders might even price their dogs according to weight, as if that alone should define a dog's value. And their prices are usually outrageous. It's all hogwash. There is only one Yorkshire Terrier breed. Period. And no matter what his size, he is considered a Toy breed. Whether an individual weighs 2 pounds or 6 pounds or 12 pounds, he's still just a Yorkshire Terrier, which is a Toy breed. Unfortunately, Yorkies under 3 or 4 pounds are greater risks when it comes to health. Their bones are more fragile. There isn't enough room in their mouth for healthy teeth. Their internal organs are often weak and can fail suddenly. They tend to have difficulty regulating their blood sugar and can go into hypoglycemic shock if they go too long without eating. Responsible Yorkshire Terrier breeders never try to produce these high-risk creatures. If a tiny Yorkie pops up in one of their normal-size litters, they find the best home they can for it. But they try not to produce them in the first place. So if possible, try to stick with Yorkies who will mature at 4 pounds and up. They have the best chance of living a normal healthy life. How can you tell whether a Yorkshire Terrier puppy will mature at 4 pounds and up? There's a rule of thumb that says a puppy will most likely mature at 4 pounds and up if he already weighs at least 2 pounds at 10-12 weeks old. It's not perfect, but it's usually pretty close. In fact, if you're looking for a robust Yorkie, don't pass up individuals who are at the top end of of normal (7 pounds) or even over-sized individuals who are 10 or 12 pounds. They're still plenty small and they make sturdier pets.   The short answer is No, there's only the one breed. Some people think a ""Teacup"" Yorkie is a different kind of Yorkshire Terrier. Not true. See the Size section just above this one. That section should answer your questions about the different sizes of Yorkies. But certainly the different sizes can look different. For example, a 3-pounder looks quite delicate, compared to a sturdy 8-pounder. Grooming can also make one Yorkshire Terrier look different from another. If you've been to a dog show or seen one on TV, you'll see that those Yorkies with their flowing coats look different from, say, your neighbor's clipped-short Yorkie. Show dog coats are sculpted just so, to win ribbons. But those styles are woefully impractical for a family companion. Many show dogs have to be carried everywhere or confined to crates or concrete kennel runs so they don't get messy playing in the back yard. Or else the breeder pins up all the hair with curlers, rubber bands, and barrettes. I love Yorkies, but I don't like to see them like that. It just looks.... wrong.   Yorkies love the outdoors in pleasant weather. These active little dogs really deserve an outdoor yard where they can stretch their legs. In theory, Yorkies can get most of their exercise indoors. The problem is that a Yorkshire Terrier can become too hyped-up if they're forced to exercise entirely by running around the house. In my Respect Training book for puppies, I explain why you should always encourage calmness indoors. A dog who dashes around, jumping and barking, is keeping himself in an excitable, over-stimulated state of mind. That isn't psychologically healthy and usually leads to behavior problems. So try to take your Yorkshire Terrier outside. You can keep a Yorkie in an apartment with no yard. But he'll be much happier with a fenced yard, however small, where he can stretch his legs and run around. Yorkies are bright little dogs who would also appreciate mental exercise. Just some interesting activities that engage his mind: interactive dog toys; a miniature homemade obstacle course; learning tricks; games such as Hide 'n Seek.   I love the short hair on this young Yorkshire Terrier! It really lets you see his expressive face. Most Yorkies are bright and quick to learn, though that often depends on what you're trying to teach them. They tend to learn tricks readily: Beg, Dance, Spin, Roll Over. Of course they expect a treat after they perform. They can be little divas! It's more challenging to teach a Yorkie to walk properly on a leash. They can be very opinionated, so they dislike the leash ""telling them what to do"" and may dart this way and that, or refuse to walk at all. The two main behavior problems in Yorkies: A COVERED potty area is strongly recommended. Sometimes a doggy door is necessary so your Yorkshire Terrier can run outside the moment he feels the urge in his tiny bladder. Or teach him to use an indoor litter box. All of these issues – walking on a leash, housebreaking, litter box training, stopping barking – are taught in my puppy training book, Respect Training For Puppies (30 seconds to a calm, polite, well-behaved puppy). Or see my advice on → dog training   Keen of eye and sharp of tongue, most Yorkshire Terriers are very quick to announce strangers at the door. Once the visitor comes in, some Yorkies will be friendly and outgoing. But many others have the standoffish or suspicious nature of a true terrier. Unfortunately, suspicious dogs can morph into shrill dogs who won't stop barking. And shrill dogs can easily turn nasty. You must teach a Yorkshire Terrier that he doesn't need to like strangers, but he does need to accept them politely.   A better question is rather, ""Are Yorkies SAFE with children?"" My answer is, ""With most children under about the age of 9 or 10.... no."" A child can seriously injure a Yorkshire Terrier by stepping on him, or by sitting on him when he's curled under a blanket or pillow, where he frequently likes to sleep. No matter how well-meaning, young children cannot help being clumsy. That a child meant well is little solace to a Yorkshire Terrier who has been accidentally stepped on, sat on, rolled on, squeezed, or dropped onto the patio. In addition, many Yorkies feel overwhelmed by the loud voices, roughhousing, and quick movements that children can't help making – and stress and fearfulness (even defensive biting) may be the result. Safety is especially an issue with the smallest Yorkies. Larger individuals are sturdier.   In your own household, yes. Most Yorkies are great with other dogs and cats in your family. But I don't recommend keeping the tinier Yorkies in a home with large dogs. A toy dog can be injured simply by a larger dog jumping around with enthusiasm and accidentally landing on the smaller one. With strange dogs, Yorkies are surprisingly bossy and scrappy. If you're out for a walk and your Yorkie spies another dog, he might begin barking and lunging. The bigger the dog, the more demonstrative the Yorkie seems to become. Some people find this funny, but it isn't. As with over-reactivity in the house, over-reactivity outdoors puts a dog into an unhealthy mental state and should be stopped immediately.   If you leave the coat too long, it drags on the ground and picks up debris. You must be totally committed to frequent grooming. Great news! Yorkshire Terriers shed very little, produce very little dander, and are one of the best breeds for allergy sufferers. The bad news.... without frequent brushing and combing, Yorkshire Terriers become a matted mess. Mats and tangles are painful. When hairs fuse together, they pull on the dog's skin whenever he walks. Especially look for mats behind the ears, under the arms, and on the stomach. In longhaired dogs, I always clip the groin (and anal area) short so it stays clean and sanitary when the dog goes to the bathroom. Another example of a classic short clip. If you can't commit to the brushing, you have to commit to frequent trimming to keep the coat short, neat, and healthy. For the easiest maintenance, you can shear the coat very short with clippers. Then you won't need to brush it at all. Personally, I love this sheared cut. It's so easy to care for, so comfortable for the dog, and makes a Yorkshire Terrier look like a cute puppy throughout his life!   Yorkies are especially vulnerable to injury, liver disease, slipping kneecaps, and eye diseases such as cataracts. Like most toy breeds, Yorkshire Terriers are usually long-lived, with a typical lifespan of 12-15 years. And as with most toy breeds, the leading health problem in Yorkies is injury. Leg fractures from falling or jumping off things or being stepped on. Choking on something tiny they find on the floor. Being overdosed with something toxic, even a medication or flea powder. Being attacked or jumped on by a larger dog.... the list goes on. When you own a Yorkshire Terrier, you must take extra safety precautions – ongoing supervision and surveillance of what's going on around your little guy. Be careful where you step or sit. Don't allow leaps from high furniture. Keep small objects picked up off the floor. Close all gaps in fences and gates. As far as diseases go.... Liver shunt is a very serious problem in Yorkshire Terriers. At one veterinary university, a full one-third of their liver shunt patients are Yorkies. You're taking a big risk if you buy or adopt a Yorkshire Terrier without doing a simple blood test to see if his liver is normal. Liver shunt requires specialist care and often tricky surgery, and the dog doesn't always survive. Expensive surgery may also be required for Eye diseases are also worrisome; lots of Yorkies are blind from cataracts. Here is my complete list of health problems in Yorkshire Terriers.

(feeding, vaccinations, neutering, veterinarians, and more).   Rich gold coloration. The dark gray ""saddle"" on the back is called blue in Yorkshire Terriers. The official Yorkshire Terrier clubs, along with breeders who show Yorkies in the conformation ring, assert that the ONLY correct colors are tan or gold, with a blue saddle. Blue?? Yes, it looks more like gray, but in the canine world, blue is the term that is used. In Yorkies, the blue is supposed to be dark steel blue, but is often more silvery blue. Interestingly, when Yorkshire Terrier puppies are born, they're black and tan. As they mature, the black becomes blue. Yorkies do come in other colors (deemed ""incorrect"" by their national club): The official clubs and show breeders disqualify all these colors from showing in the conformation ring. Nevertheless, those colors aren't going away. Even though they can't be shown, the AKC accepts them for registration and breeding, and you can show them in activities such as obedience and agility. There is even a tricolored ""spin-off"" breed called the Biewer (pronounced Beaver) Terrier. Created in Germany in the 1980s, a Biewer is essentially a tricolor Yorkie, with the colors needing to appear in a very specific pattern. Unfortunately, from a genetic standpoint, creating dogs with an emphasis on ""perfect"" markings is never a good thing. You end up with a limited, non-diverse gene pool. Also, focusing on something as trivial as color usually leads to problems with health and temperament down the line. Currently Biewers are being marketed for pretty high prices.   Yorkie puppies are born black and tan, with the black morphing into blue as they mature. Congratulations! I'll be happy to show you how to raise and train your new family member. I can help you with that, too. Yorkies are extremely common in the United States. Out of 189 breeds in the American Kennel Club, where 1 is most popular and 189 is least popular, Yorkshire Terriers rank 9th. Very easy to find. The problem is finding one whose temperament will be stable, rather than hyperactive or shrill, and one whose liver, knees, and eyessight will remain healthy. You can buy a Yorkshire Terrier from a show breeder, who breeds Yorkies to match a detailed standard of appearance for the dog show ring. You can also buy a Yorkshire Terrier from people who ""just breed pets."" Unfortunately, this is like trying to navigate a minefield. Puppy producers have flooded the Internet with pictures of adorable Yorkie pups accompanied by ridiculous come-ons such as ""Tiny teacup baby Yorkies with exquisite baby doll faces, starting at two thousand dollars!"" Also be aware that some unscrupulous sellers offer ""purebred"" Yorkies that are actually crosses or mixes. Not that there's anything wrong with a crossbred or mixed Yorkshire Terrier – far from it – but it would be nice to be sure of exactly what you're buying. Did you know there's a quick and simple DNA test that can tell you definitively which breeds make up any given dog? Here's one quick way to tell the difference between a responsible breeder and an irresponsible ""puppy producer"" – health certifications. BOTH PARENTS of a Yorkshire Terrier puppy should have: Finally, I wouldn't take any Yorkie, either a puppy or an adult, unless If a seller can't show you those certificates, the puppies are higher risk for health problems. You might choose to accept that risk. But then you need to be willing (and able) to pay a couple thousand bucks for future surgeries and lifelong meds if your Yorkshire Terrier ends up blind from cataracts, or needing multiple surgeries for bad knee joints and liver disease. See my advice on → finding  a good dog   Yorkies are often available from dog rescue groups. Some also show up at animal shelters, though these are usually snapped up quickly because so many prospective owners are seeking a tiny dog. A Yorkshire Terrier might be turned over to a rescue group or shelter because of housebreaking issues or barking. But Yorkies are often owned by elderly people, and when elderly people pass away, if no one in the family is willing to take the dog, he gets abandoned, even if he has no behavior issues at all.   The Silky Terrier looks like a largish (8-12 pounds) Yorkshire Terrier. Compared to Yorkies, Silkys tend to be more stable in temperament, but also more terrier-ish – more independent and hardier. Silkys are fine for some allergy-sufferers, but perhaps not as tried-and-true as a Yorkie. If your heart is set on a tiny dog and you're allergic, the light-shedding Maltese also fits the bill. Compared to Yorkshire Terriers, Maltese have a softer, sweeter temperament, as their ancestry is not terrier, but spaniel. The Toy Poodle is the most hypo-allergenic of all coated breeds. Compared to a Yorkie, the Toy Poodle has a softer, sweeter temperament, is very quick to learn, and is easier to housebreak. The trade-off is more grooming. If you would prefer a spunkier little guy with a low-maintenance coat, and you don't mind some shedding, consider the Toy Fox Terrier. He's similar to a Yorkie and a Silky in being a blend of toy and terrier traits."
